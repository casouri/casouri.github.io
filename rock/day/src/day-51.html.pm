之前说的封面好看想买的专辑，音乐意外地不错。其中我最喜欢的就是这首结尾曲。一直搞不清楚 contra 是什么意思，问了朋友，结论是有反叛精神之人的意思，大概）

◊lyrics{
I had a feeling once
That you and I
Could tell each other everything
For two months

But even with an oath
With truth on our side
When you turn away from me
It's not right

I think you're a Contra
I think you're a Contra
I think you're a Contra
I think you're a Contra

My revolution thoughts
Your little arrows of desire
I want to trace them to the source
And the wire

But it's not useful now
Since we've both made up our minds
You're going to watch out for yourself
And so will I

I think you're a Contra
And I think that you've lied
Don't call me a Contra
Til you've tried

You wanted good schools
And friends with pools
You're not a Contra

You wanted Rock and Roll
Complete control
Well, I don't know

Never pick sides
Never choose between two
But I just wanted you
I just wanted you

You said, "Never pick sides
Never choose between two"
But I just wanted you
I just wanted you

I think you're a Contra
And I think that you've lied
Don't call me a Contra
Til you've tried
