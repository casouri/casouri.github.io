这首专辑里 “Dancing With Mr. D” 也很棒，还有 “Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo”。不过这张确实没有像其他滚石专辑一样，首首让我拍案叫绝。

◊lyrics{
Angie, Angie
When will those clouds all disappear?
Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here?
With no loving in our soul
And no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied
But Angie, Angie
You can't say we never tried
Angie, you're beautiful
But ain't it time we said goodbye?
Angie, I still love you
Remember all those nights we cried?
All the dreams we held so close
Seemed to all go up in smoke
Let me whisper in your ear
Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here?

Oh, Angie, don't you weep
All your kisses still taste sweet
I hate that sadness in your eyes
Angie, Angie
Ain't it time we said goodbye?
Angie, Angie
Ain't it time we said goodbye?
With no loving in our souls
And no money in our coats
You can't say were satisfied
But Angie, I still love you, Baby
Everywhere I look I see your eyes
There ain't a woman that comes close to you
Come on Baby, dry your eyes
But Angie, Angie
Ain't it good to be alive?
Angie, Angie
They can't say we never tried
