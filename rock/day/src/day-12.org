我前几天在学校食堂的广播里听到的这首歌www

{{{BEGIN_LYRICS}}}
We get it almost every night \\
When that moon is big and bright \\
It's a supernatural delight \\
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight \\
 \\
Everybody here is out of sight \\
They don't bark, and they don't bite \\
They keep things loose, they keep 'em tight \\
Everybody was dancin' in the moonlight \\
 \\
Dancin' in the moonlight \\
Everybody's feelin' warm and bright \\
It's such a fine and natural sight \\
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight \\
 \\
We like our fun and we never fight \\
You can't dance and stay uptight \\
It's a supernatural delight \\
Everybody was dancin' in the moonlight \\
 \\
Dancin' in the moonlight \\
Everybody's feelin' warm and bright \\
It's such a fine and natural sight \\
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight \\
 \\
We get it almost every night \\
When that moon is big and bright \\
It's a supernatural delight \\
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight \\
 \\
Dancin' in the moonlight \\
Everybody's feelin' warm and bright \\
It's such a fine and natural sight \\
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight \\
 \\
Dancin' in the moonlight \\
Everybody's feelin' warm and bright \\
It's such a fine and natural sight \\
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight \\
 \\
Dancin' in the moonlight \\
Everybody's feelin' warm and bright \\
It's such a fine and natural sight \\
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight \\
 \\
Dancin' in the moonlight \\
Everybody's feelin' warm and bright \\
It's such a fine and natural sight \\
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight \\
 \\
Dancin' in the moonlight \\
Everybody's feelin' warm and bright \\
It's such a fine and natural sight \\
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight \\
