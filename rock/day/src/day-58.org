*Charles Bradley - [[https://youtu.be/yBdTVmSVq14][Why Is It So Hard]] - 2011*

Backed by The Menahan Street Band. Live from Mellow Johnny's Bike Shop in Austin, TX, during KEXP's broadcast at SXSW. Recorded 3/17/2011.

之前找たそがれ的时候不是加了个分享盗版音乐的reddit组嘛，之后那个组里有人分享Black Puma的专辑，reddit给我推送了。所以我就去油管听听看，然后推荐列表里有这场表演的视频。

演唱很有力量和情感，同时又很平稳。

{{{BEGIN_LYRICS}}}
Why is it so hard \\
To make it in America \\
I try so hard \\
To make it in America \\
 \\
A land of milk and honey \\
A land supposed to be built with love \\
It take love and understanding \\
To live and let live \\
 \\
I was born in Gainesville Florida \\
I traveled far and wide \\
Then I moved to Brooklyn, New York \\
Had hard times, for sometime I hold on \\
 \\
Why is it so hard \\
To make it in America \\
I try so hard \\
To make it in America \\
 \\
Seemed like nothing was goin' right \\
So I said to myself \\
You got to move away from here \\
I went to upstate New York \\
A little town they call Poughkeepsie \\
Got me a job \\
To get away from all this stress \\
But I couldn't get away \\
No matter how far I went \\
Seems like nothing gonna change \\
Everything still remained the same \\
 \\
Why is it so hard \\
To make it in America \\
I try so hard \\
To make it in America \\
 \\
Why, tell me, tell me \\
We gotta make a change, in America \\
Help me somebody \\
