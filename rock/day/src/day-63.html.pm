干草叉还是 Bandcamp 上看2020年摇滚新曲排名上看到这张，Country Western 的首发同名专辑。想着首发专辑应该有亮点就买了。刚开始听感觉一般，听多了感觉挺不错。

◊lyrics{
Better take a walk try and clear your head
Better take a drug try and go to bed
Better listen up to what I said
at anytime

I would never dare but just suggest
I don’t presume to know what’s best
Maybe I ain’t smart but I ain't lying
at anytime

Sure I’ve been accused without defense
Visions skewed and happenstance
I can be lost and found or lost
at anytime

Try to pick it up when you’re falling back
Put it in your cup, just a little swag
It ain't cool or cruel its just the wolves at your door
at anytime

Better take a walk try and clear your head
Better take a drug try and go to bed
Better listen up to what I said
at anytime
