If there is one classic way of Mick and I working together, this is it. I had the riff and the chorus line, Mick got stuck into the verses. Just like Satisfaction. Wild Horses was about the usual thing of not wanting to be on the road, being a million miles from where you want to be. -- Keith Richards, 1993 ([[http://timeisonourside.com/SOWildH.html][Time Is On Our Side]], 2018)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Childhood living is easy to do.
The things you wanted
I bought them for you.
Graceless lady
you know how I am
you know I can't let you
slide through my hands.

Wild horses
couldn't drag me away.
Wild, wild horses
couldn't drag me away.

I watched you suffer
a dull aching pain.
Now you decided to
show me the same.
But no sweeping exits or offstage lines
could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind.

Wild Horses
couldn't drag me away.
Wild, wild horses
couldn't drag me away.

I know I've dreamed you a sin and a lie
I have my freedom but I don't have much time
Faith has been broken tears must be cried
Let's do some living after we die

Wild Horses
couldn't drag me away.
Wild, wild horses
couldn't drag me away.

Wild Horses
couldn't drag me away.
Wild, wild horses
we'll ride them some day
