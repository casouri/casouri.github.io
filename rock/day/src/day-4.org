*The Doors - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv8GW1GaoIc][Riders on the Storm]] - 1971*

之前提到的那个笑话，引用油管上的[[https://www.youtube.com/user/Fleuryette][Fleuryette]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Went to Pére Lachaise in Paris to see Jim Morrison's grave last September, all of a sudden this Australian dude rocks up in full leather gear, blaring this song as loud as he possibly could, barging through the small crowd. Everybody, I mean EVERYBODY is staring at him, and he just shouts "What? It's appropriate!" I never laughed so hard in a cemetery. I still think of that guy sometimes.﻿

Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Into this house we're born
Into this world we're thrown
Like a dog without a bone
An actor out alone
Riders on the storm

There's a killer on the road
His brain is squirmin' like a toad
Take a long holiday
Let your children play
If ya give this man a ride
Sweet memory will die
Killer on the road, yeah

Girl ya gotta love your man
Girl ya gotta love your man
Take him by the hand
Make him understand
The world on you depends
Our life will never end
Gotta love your man, yeah

Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Into this house we're born
Into this world we're thrown
Like a dog without a bone
An actor out alone
Riders on the storm

Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
