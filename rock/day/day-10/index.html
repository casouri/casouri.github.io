      <p>我超喜欢开头和结尾的和声。据说 Mick Jigger 是听到 “Hey Jude”
      的传奇结尾以后获得的灵感。这张专辑里九首歌我每首都超喜欢，简直爆炸。其他的八首找时间写，这首歌只是随便挑的<span class=

          <p>I saw her today at the reception
          <br>
          A glass of wine in her hand
          <br>
          I knew she would meet her connection
          <br>
          At her feet was her footloose man</p>
          <p>No, you can't always get what you want
          <br>
          You can't always get what you want
          <br>
          You can't always get what you want
          <br>
          But if you try sometime you find
          <br>
          You get what you need</p>
          <p>I saw her today at the reception
          <br>
          A glass of wine in her hand
          <br>
          I knew she was gonna meet her connection
          <br>
          At her feet was her footloose man</p>
          <p>You can't always get what you want
          <br>
          You can't always get what you want
          <br>
          You can't always get what you want
          <br>
          But if you try sometimes you might find
          <br>
          You get what you need</p>
          <p>But I went down to the demonstration
          <br>
          To get your fair share of abuse
          <br>
          Singing, "We're gonna vent our frustration
          <br>
          If we don't we're gonna blow a fifty-amp fuse"</p>
          <p>You can't always get what you want
          <br>
          You can't always get what you want
          <br>
          You can't always get what you want
          <br>
          But if you try sometimes well you just might find
          <br>
          You get what you need</p>
          <p>I went down to the Chelsea drugstore
          <br>
          To get your prescription filled
          <br>
          I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy
          <br>
          And man, did he look pretty ill
          <br>
          We decided that we would have a soda
          <br>
          My favorite flavor, cherry red
          <br>
          I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy
          <br>
          Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was "dead"
          <br>
          I said to him</p>
          <p>You can't always get what you want
          <br>
          You can't always get what you want
          <br>
          You can't always get what you want
          <br>
          But if you try sometimes you just might find
          <br>
          You get what you need</p>
          <p>You get what you need, yeah, oh baby</p>
          <p>I saw her today at the reception
          <br>
          In her glass was a bleeding man
          <br>
          She was practiced at the art of deception
          <br>
          Well I could tell by her blood-stained hands</p>
          <p>You can't always get what you want
          <br>
          You can't always get what you want
          <br>
          You can't always get what you want
          <br>
          But if you try sometimes you just might find
          <br>
          You just might find
          <br>
          You get what you need</p>
          <p>You can't always get what you want
          <br>
          You can't always get what you want
          <br>
          You can't always get what you want
          <br>
          But if you try sometimes you just might find
          <br>
          You just might find
          <br>
          You get what you need, oh yeah</p>
