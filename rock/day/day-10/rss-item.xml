<p>
我超喜欢开头和结尾的和声。据说Mick Jigger听到Hey Jude的传奇结尾以后获得了灵感。

<p>
"You Can't Always Get What You Want" was recorded on 16 and 17 November 1968 at Olympic Sound Studios in London. It features the London Bach Choir opening the song (the choir opening is only on the album version), highlighting throughout, and bringing it to its conclusion.

I saw her today at the reception <br />
A glass of wine in her hand <br />
I knew she would meet her connection <br />
At her feet was her footloose man <br />
 <br />
No, you can't always get what you want <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
But if you try sometime you find <br />
You get what you need <br />
 <br />
I saw her today at the reception <br />
A glass of wine in her hand <br />
I knew she was gonna meet her connection <br />
At her feet was her footloose man <br />
 <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
But if you try sometimes you might find <br />
You get what you need <br />
 <br />
But I went down to the demonstration <br />
To get your fair share of abuse <br />
Singing, "We're gonna vent our frustration <br />
If we don't we're gonna blow a fifty-amp fuse" <br />
 <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
But if you try sometimes well you just might find <br />
You get what you need <br />
 <br />
I went down to the Chelsea drugstore <br />
To get your prescription filled <br />
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy <br />
And man, did he look pretty ill <br />
We decided that we would have a soda <br />
My favorite flavor, cherry red <br />
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy <br />
Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was "dead" <br />
I said to him <br />
 <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
But if you try sometimes you just might find <br />
You get what you need <br />
 <br />
You get what you need, yeah, oh baby <br />
 <br />
I saw her today at the reception <br />
In her glass was a bleeding man <br />
She was practiced at the art of deception <br />
Well I could tell by her blood-stained hands <br />
 <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
But if you try sometimes you just might find <br />
You just might find <br />
You get what you need <br />
 <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
But if you try sometimes you just might find <br />
You just might find <br />
You get what you need, oh yeah <br />
