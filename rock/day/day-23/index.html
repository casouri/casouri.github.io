In the summertime when the weather is hot <br />
You can stretch right up and touch the sky <br />
When the weather's fine <br />
You got women, you got women on your mind <br />
Have a drink, have a drive <br />
Go out and see what you can find <br />
 <br />
If her daddy's rich take her out for a meal <br />
If her daddy's poor just do what you feel <br />
Speed along the lane <br />
Do a turn or return the twenty-five <br />
When the sun goes down <br />
You can make it, make it good and really fine <br />
 <br />
We're not bad people <br />
We're not dirty, we're not mean <br />
We love everybody but we do as we please <br />
When the weather's fine <br />
We go fishin' or go swimmin' in the sea <br />
We're always happy <br />
Life's for livin' yeah, that's our philosophy <br />
 <br />
Sing along with us <br />
Dee dee dee-dee dee <br />
Dah dah dah-dah dah <br />
Yeah we're hap-happy <br />

 <br />
When the winter's here, yeah it's party time <br />
Bring your bottle, wear your bright clothes <br />
It'll soon be summertime <br />
And we'll sing again <br />
We'll go drivin' or maybe we'll settle down <br />
If she's rich, if she's nice <br />
Bring your friends and we'll all go into town <br />
 <br />
Chh chh-chh, uh, chh chh-chh, uh <br />
