<pre class="example">
Didn't I make you feel
Like you were the only man, yeah
Didn't I give you everything that a woman possibly can?
But with all the love I give ya
It's never enough
But I'm gonna show you, baby, that a woman can be tough
So come on, come on, come on, come on
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby!
Break it!
Break another little bit of my heart now, honey
Have a!
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
You know you got it if it makes you feel good
You're out on the street (looking good)
And you know deep down in your heart that it ain't right
And ah, you never, never hear me when I cry at night
And oh oh I, I tell myself that I can't stand the pain
But when you hold me in your arms, I say it again
So come on, come on, come on, come on
And take it!
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby!
Hey, break it!
Break another little bit of my heart now, baby
You can have a!
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
You know you got it if it makes you feel good
Hey, hey
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby!
Oh, break it!
Break another little bit of my heart now, honey
Hey, have a!
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
Come on, take it!
