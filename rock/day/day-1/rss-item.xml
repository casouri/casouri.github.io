<div class="lyrics">

<p>
Didn't I make you feel <br />
Like you were the only man, yeah <br />
Didn't I give you everything that a woman possibly can? <br />
But with all the love I give ya <br />
It's never enough <br />
But I'm gonna show you, baby, that a woman can be tough <br />
So come on, come on, come on, come on <br />
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby! <br />
Break it! <br />
Break another little bit of my heart now, honey <br />
Have a! <br />
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby <br />
You know you got it if it makes you feel good <br />
You're out on the street (looking good) <br />
And you know deep down in your heart that it ain't right <br />
And ah, you never, never hear me when I cry at night <br />
And oh oh I, I tell myself that I can't stand the pain <br />
But when you hold me in your arms, I say it again <br />
So come on, come on, come on, come on <br />
And take it! <br />
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby! <br />
Hey, break it! <br />
Break another little bit of my heart now, baby <br />
You can have a! <br />
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby <br />
You know you got it if it makes you feel good <br />
Hey, hey <br />
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby! <br />
Oh, break it! <br />
Break another little bit of my heart now, honey <br />
Hey, have a! <br />
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby <br />
Come on, take it! <br />
