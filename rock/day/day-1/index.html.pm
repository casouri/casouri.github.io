这首歌由 Jerry Ragovoy 和 Bert Berns 创作，Erma Franklin 在1967年录制了第一个版本。在1968年，◊link["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_and_the_Holding_Company"]{Big Brother and the Holding Company} 和当时作为领唱的 Janis 的表演让这首歌真正出名。

<2021-06-13 Sun> 我不记得什么时候听到这首歌的了，但 Janis 的演唱让我大受震撼。这是发自灵魂深处的歌声。我已经忘了为什么三年前用这首歌开始余日摇滚这个系列，当时一定深受感动。当然，现在 Janis 依然是我最喜欢的歌手。不仅是演唱能力，她对歌曲的诠释也很天才，我去找了原版的 “Piece of My Heart”，比起 Janis 的版本远远不及。之后会介绍的几首她的翻唱歌也是如此。（说是翻唱，当年原创歌手也才刚刚开始流行。）


◊lyrics{
Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on!

Didn't I make you feel like you were the only man - yeah!
An' didn't I give you nearly everything that a woman possibly can ?
Honey, you know I did!
And each time I tell myself that I, well I think I've had enough,
But I'm gonna show you, baby, that a woman can be tough.

I want you to come on, come on, come on, come on and take it,
Take it!
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby!
Oh, oh, break it!
Break another little bit of my heart now, darling, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, oh, have a!
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby,
You know you got it if it makes you feel good,
Oh, yes indeed.

You're out on the streets looking good,
And baby deep down in your heart I guess you know that it ain't right,
Never, never, never, never, never, never hear me when I cry at night,
Babe, and I cry all the time!
But each time I tell myself that I, well I can't stand the pain,
But when you hold me in your arms, I'll sing it once again.

I'll say come on, come on, come on, come on and take it!
Take it!
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby.
Oh, oh, break it!
Break another little bit of my heart now, darling, yeah,
Oh, oh, have a!
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby,
You know you got it, child, if it makes you feel good.

I need you to come on, come on, come on, come on and take it,
Take it!
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby!
Oh, oh, break it!
Break another little bit of my heart, now darling, yeah, c'mon now.
Oh, oh, have a
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby.
You know you got it - whoahhhhh!!

Take it!
Take it! Take another little piece of my heart now, baby,
Oh, oh, break it!
Break another little bit of my heart, now darling, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Oh, oh, have a
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby, hey,
You know you got it, child, if it makes you feel good.
