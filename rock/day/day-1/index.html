      <p>这首歌由 Jerry Ragovoy 和 Bert Berns 创作<span class=
      "full-width-mark">，</span>Erma Franklin 在1967年录制了第一个版本<span class=
      "full-width-mark">。</span>在1968年<span class=

      "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_and_the_Holding_Company">Big
      Brother and the Holding Company</a> 和当时作为领唱的 Janis
      的表演让这首歌真正出名<span class="full-width-mark">。</span></p>
      <p>&lt;2021-06-13 Sun&gt; 我不记得什么时候听到这首歌的了<span class=
      "full-width-mark">，</span>但 Janis 的演唱让我大受震撼<span class=
      "full-width-mark">。</span>这是发自灵魂深处的歌声<span class=
      "full-width-mark">。</span>我已经忘了为什么三年前用这首歌开始余日摇滚这个系列<span class=
      "full-width-mark">，</span>当时一定深受感动<span class=
      "full-width-mark">。</span>当然<span class=
      "full-width-mark">，</span>现在 Janis 依然是我最喜欢的歌手<span class=
      "full-width-mark">。</span>不仅是演唱能力<span class=
      "full-width-mark">，</span>她对歌曲的诠释也很天才<span class=
      "full-width-mark">，</span>我去找了原版的 <span class=
      "full-width-mark">“</span>Piece of My Heart<span class=
      "squeeze full-width-mark">”</span><span class=
      "full-width-mark">，</span>比起 Janis 的版本远远不及<span class=
      "full-width-mark">。</span>之后会介绍的几首她的翻唱歌也是如此<span class=
      "squeeze full-width-mark">。</span><span class=
      "full-width-mark">（</span>说是翻唱<span class=
      "full-width-mark">，</span>当年原创歌手也才刚刚开始流行<span class=

          <p>Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on!</p>
          <p>Didn't I make you feel like you were the only man - yeah!
          <br>
          An' didn't I give you nearly everything that a woman possibly
          can ?
          <br>
          Honey, you know I did!
          <br>
          And each time I tell myself that I, well I think I've had
          enough,
          <br>
          But I'm gonna show you, baby, that a woman can be tough.</p>
          <p>I want you to come on, come on, come on, come on and take
          it,
          <br>
          Take it!
          <br>
          Take another little piece of my heart now, baby!
          <br>
          Oh, oh, break it!
          <br>
          Break another little bit of my heart now, darling, yeah, yeah,
          yeah.
          <br>
          Oh, oh, have a!
          <br>
          Have another little piece of my heart now, baby,
          <br>
          You know you got it if it makes you feel good,
          <br>
          Oh, yes indeed.</p>
          <p>You're out on the streets looking good,
          <br>
          And baby deep down in your heart I guess you know that it ain't
          right,
          <br>
          Never, never, never, never, never, never hear me when I cry at
          night,
          <br>
          Babe, and I cry all the time!
          <br>
          But each time I tell myself that I, well I can't stand the
          pain,
          <br>
          But when you hold me in your arms, I'll sing it once again.</p>
          <p>I'll say come on, come on, come on, come on and take it!
          <br>
          Take it!
          <br>
          Take another little piece of my heart now, baby.
          <br>
          Oh, oh, break it!

          Break another little bit of my heart now, darling, yeah,
          <br>
          Oh, oh, have a!
          <br>
          Have another little piece of my heart now, baby,
          <br>
          You know you got it, child, if it makes you feel good.</p>
          <p>I need you to come on, come on, come on, come on and take
          it,
          <br>
          Take it!
          <br>
          Take another little piece of my heart now, baby!
          <br>
          Oh, oh, break it!
          <br>
          Break another little bit of my heart, now darling, yeah, c'mon
