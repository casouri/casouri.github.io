<b>Kaleo - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXsK_u4ixI">I Can't Go on Without You</a></b>
</p>

<p>
这首歌是1948年Bull Moose Jackson的单曲，链接里的是经由Kaleo改编后的现场演出。相对于他们专辑里的版本，我更喜欢这首。这首更加过渡更平滑自然，专辑里的版本感觉稍微有点快。
</p>

<p>
Kaleo是一支来自冰岛，有蓝调背景的摇滚乐队。他们有一些超级酷的现场演出：在浮冰，火山口这些地方！我比较好奇的是他们的手指不会冻僵么……在浮冰上演出的时候。
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUY8XtieKLQ">Bull Moose Jackson的版本</a>也很有意思。

<p>
Well they thought they were made for each other <br />
One thinking of one another <br />
Never thinking just for one second <br />
She would take a different attraction <br />
 <br />
We don't want that <br />
We don't want that <br />
We don't want that <br />
Oh no <br />
 <br />
We don't want that <br />
We don't want that <br />
We don't want that <br />
Oh no <br />
 <br />
I can't go on without you <br />
I can't go on without you <br />
Can't go on without you, yeah <br />
I can't go on without you <br />
 <br />
Oh so, what's the point of breaking my sweet heart? <br />
She wanted me to let down my guard <br />
Well, you know what they say, it's better that way <br />
So, so you better hush and walk away <br />
 <br />
We don't want that <br />
We don't want that <br />
We don't want that <br />
Oh no <br />
 <br />
We don't want that <br />
We don't want that <br />
We don't want that <br />
Oh no <br />
 <br />
I can't go on without you <br />
I can't go on without you, oh lord <br />
Can't go on without you, ooh ooh <br />
I can't go on, won't go on, living on, without you <br />
 <br />
Woah yeah <br />
Woah ah <br />
 <br />
Well, was I supposed to wait for you sweetheart? <br />
And hide away the shame <br />
Yes I keep it all inside <br />
Though the thought had crossed my mind <br />
To do all the things I regret and we don't want that <br />
 <br />
We don't want that <br />
We don't want that <br />
We don't want that <br />
Oh no <br />
 <br />
We don't want that <br />
We don't want that <br />
We don't want that <br />
Oh no <br />
I can't, I can't, I can't go on without you <br />
I can't go on without you, oh lord <br />
Go on without you, ooh ooh <br />
I can't go on without you babe <br />
Yeah <br />
 <br />
Ahh, she loves me <br />
She loves me not <br />
She loves me <br />
My love's gon' love me <br />
 <br />
Oh so what is left but a broken man? <br />
'Cause nothing hurts like a woman can <br />
 <br />
I can't go on without you <br />
I can't go on without you, oh yeah <br />
Can't go on without you <br />
I can't go on without you, oh <br />
Oh without you lord, without you <br />
Without you babe, without you <br />
Oh lord, you <br />
