    <p>这首歌是1948年 Bull Moose Jackson 的单曲，链接里的是经由 Kaleo 改编后的现场演出。相对于他们专辑里的版本，我更喜欢这首。这首更加过渡更平滑自然，专辑里的版本感觉稍微有点快。</p><p>Kaleo是一支来自冰岛，有蓝调背景的摇滚乐队。他们有一些超级酷的现场演出：在浮冰，火山口这些地方！我比较好奇的是他们的手指不会冻僵么……在浮冰上演出的时候。</p><p>这里是 Bull Moose Jackson 的版本：<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUY8XtieKLQ">I Can’t Go on Without You</a>。</p><div><hr/><div class="lyrics"><p>Well they thought they were made for each other<br/>One thinking of one another<br/>Never thinking just for one second<br/>She would take a different attraction</p><p>We don't want that<br/>We don't want that<br/>We don't want that<br/>Oh no</p><p>We don't want that<br/>We don't want that<br/>We don't want that<br/>Oh no</p><p>I can't go on without you<br/>I can't go on without you<br/>Can't go on without you, yeah<br/>I can't go on without you</p><p>Oh so, what's the point of breaking my sweet heart?<br/>She wanted me to let down my guard<br/>Well, you know what they say, it's better that way<br/>So, so you better hush and walk away</p><p>We don't want that<br/>We don't want that<br/>We don't want that<br/>Oh no</p><p>We don't want that<br/>We don't want that<br/>We don't want that<br/>Oh no</p><p>I can't go on without you<br/>I can't go on without you, oh lord<br/>Can't go on without you, ooh ooh<br/>I can't go on, won't go on, living on, without you</p><p>Woah yeah<br/>Woah ah</p><p>Well, was I supposed to wait for you sweetheart?<br/>And hide away the shame<br/>Yes I keep it all inside<br/>Though the thought had crossed my mind<br/>To do all the things I regret and we don't want that</p><p>We don't want that<br/>We don't want that<br/>We don't want that<br/>Oh no</p><p>We don't want that<br/>We don't want that<br/>We don't want that<br/>Oh no<br/>I can't, I can't, I can't go on without you<br/>I can't go on without you, oh lord<br/>Go on without you, ooh ooh<br/>I can't go on without you babe<br/>Yeah</p><p>Ahh, she loves me<br/>She loves me not<br/>She loves me<br/>My love's gon' love me</p><p>Oh so what is left but a broken man?<br/>'Cause nothing hurts like a woman can</p><p>I can't go on without you<br/>I can't go on without you, oh yeah<br/>Can't go on without you<br/>I can't go on without you, oh<br/>Oh without you lord, without you<br/>Without you babe, without you<br/>Oh lord, you</p></div></div>
