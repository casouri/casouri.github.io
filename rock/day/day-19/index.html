          <p>Can anybody find me somebody to love?</p>
          <p>Ooh, each morning I get up I die a little
          <br>
          Can barely stand on my feet
          <br>
          (Take a look at yourself) Take a look in the mirror and cry
          (and cry)
          <br>
          Lord, what you're doing to me (yeah yeah)
          <br>
          I have spent all my years in believing you
          <br>
          But I just can't get no relief, Lord!
          <br>
          Somebody (somebody) ooh somebody (somebody)
          <br>
          Can anybody find me somebody to love?</p>
          <p>I work hard (he works hard) every day of my life
          <br>
          I work 'til I ache in my bones
          <br>
          At the end (at the end of the day)
          <br>
          I take home my hard earned pay all on my own
          <br>
          I get down (down) on my knees (knees)
          <br>
          And I start to pray
          <br>
          'Til the tears run down from my eyes
          <br>
          Lord, somebody (somebody), ooh somebody
          <br>
          (Please) can anybody find me somebody to love?</p>
          <p>Everyday (everyday) I try and I try and I try
          <br>
          But everybody wants to put me down
          <br>
          They say I'm going crazy
          <br>
          They say I got a lot of water in my brain
          <br>
          Ah, got no common sense
          <br>
          I got nobody left to believe in
          <br>
          Yeah yeah yeah yeah</p>
          <p>Oh, Lord
          <br>
          Ooh somebody, ooh somebody
          <br>
          Can anybody find me somebody to love?
          <br>
          (Can anybody find me someone to love)</p>
          <p>Got no feel, I got no rhythm
          <br>
          I just keep losing my beat (you just keep losing and losing)
          <br>
          I'm OK, I'm alright (he's alright, he's alright)
          <br>
          I ain't gonna face no defeat (yeah yeah)
          <br>
          I just gotta get out of this prison cell
          <br>
          One day (someday) I'm gonna be free, Lord!</p>
          <p>Find me somebody to love
