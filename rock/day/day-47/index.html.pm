最近没听什么新东西，发个不新的吧www

歌词让人非常感同身受（

◊lyrics{
Maybe
Oh if I could pray and I try, dear,
You might come back home, home to me.

Maybe
Whoa, if I could ever hold your little hand
Oh you might understand.
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, yeah.

Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe dear
I guess I might have done something wrong,
Honey I'd be glad to admit it.
Oh, come on home to me!
Honey maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe yeah.

Well I know that it just doesn't ever seem to matter, baby,
Oh honey, when I go out or what I'm trying to do,
Can't you see I'm still left here
And I'm holding on in needing you.

Please, please, please, please,
Oh won't you reconsider babe.
Now come on, I said come back,
Won't you come back to me!

Maybe dear, oh maybe, maybe, maybe,
Let me help you show me how.
Honey, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe,
Maybe, maybe, maybe, yeah,
Maybe, maybe, maybe, yeah.
Ooh!
