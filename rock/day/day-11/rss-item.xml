在他们不再巡演很久之后，披头士在办公室楼顶的现场演出。

<b>The Beatles - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCtzkaL2t_Y">Don't Let Me Down</a> - 1969</b>
</p>

<hr/><div class="lyrics">
<p>
Don't let me down, don't let me down <br />
Don't let me down, don't let me down <br />
 <br />
Nobody ever loved me like she does <br />
Oh, she does, yeah, she does <br />
And if somebody loved me like she do me <br />
Oh, she do me, yes, she does <br />
 <br />
Don't let me down, don't let me down <br />
Don't let me down, don't let me down <br />
 <br />
I'm in love for the first time <br />
Don't you know it's gonna last <br />
It's a love that lasts forever <br />
It's a love that had no past <br />
 <br />
Don't let me down, don't let me down <br />
Don't let me down, don't let me down <br />
 <br />
And from the first time that she really done me <br />
Oh, she done me, she done me good <br />
I guess nobody ever really done me <br />
Oh, she done me, she done me good <br />
 <br />
Don't let me down, hey, don't let me down <br />
Heee! Don't let me down <br />
 <br />
Don't let me down <br />
Don't let me down, don't let me let down <br />
Can you dig it? Don't let me down <br />
