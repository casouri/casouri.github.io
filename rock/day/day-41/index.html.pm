歌词太神，对肆意妄为的女人无可奈何的心情描述地淋漓尽致。作者太懂了吧……

我听到这首专辑是偶然，本来买的是 ◊em{The Velvet Underground & Nico} ，亚马逊不知道给我发成这张了。至于一开始为什么想买 Velvet Underground 的专辑，我是在 ◊em{Good Omens} 里听到的：天使以为恶魔车里的 Velvet Underground 是 Beboop www。（◊em{Good Omens} 前面很有趣，结尾是屎。）

我一直以为封面上的主角怀里是抱着一把吉他，后来才发现是在展示一本杂志www

◊lyrics{
Sometimes I feel so happy
Sometimes I feel so sad
Sometimes I feel so happy
But mostly you just make me mad
Baby, you just make me mad

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

Thought of you as my mountaintop
Thought of you as my peak
Thought of you as everything
I've had, but couldn't keep
I've had, but couldn't keep

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

If I could make the world as pure
And strange as what I see
I'd put you in a mirror
I put in front of me
I put in front of me

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

Skip a life completely
Stuff it in a cup
She said "money is like us in time
It lies, but can't stand up"
Down for you is up

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

It was good what we did yesterday
And I'd do it once again
The fact that you are married
Only proves you're my best friend
But it's truly, truly a sin

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes
