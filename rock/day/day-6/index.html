      <blockquote>
        On 18 May 1967, the Beatles signed a contract to appear as
        Britain's representatives on Our World, which was to be broadcast
        live internationally, via satellite, on 25 June. The Beatles were
        asked to provide a song with a message that could be easily
        understood by everyone.
