<blockquote>
<p>
这是一首传统民谣，也叫日晟蓝调。讲述了一个人在新奥尔良的悲惨生活，很多版本中还告诫兄弟姐妹不要不要重蹈覆辙。
</p>

<p>
An interview with Eric Burdon revealed that he first heard the song in a club in Newcastle, England, where it was sung by the Northumbrian folk singer Johnny Handle. The Animals were on tour with Chuck Berry and chose it because they wanted something distinctive to sing.

<p>
There is a house down in New Orleans <br />
They call the Rising Sun. <br />
And it's been the ruin of many a-poor boy <br />
And me&#x2013;oh, God&#x2013;I'm one <br />
 <br />
My mother was a tailor <br />
She sewed these new blue jeans <br />
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord <br />
Down in New Orleans <br />
 <br />
Now the only thing a gambler needs <br />
Is a suitcase and a trunk <br />
And the only time he's satisfied <br />
Is when he's on a drunk <br />
 <br />
He fills his glasses up to the brim <br />
And he'll pass the cards around <br />
And the only pleasure he gets out of life <br />
Is ramblin' from town to town <br />
 <br />
Oh, tell my baby sister <br />
Not to do what I have done! <br />
But shun that house in New Orleans <br />
They call the Rising Sun <br />
 <br />
Well it's one foot on the platform <br />
The other foot on the train! <br />
I'm goin' back to New Orleans <br />
To wear that ball and chain <br />
 <br />
 <br />
I'm a goin' back to New Orleans <br />
My race is almost run! <br />
I'm goin' back to end my life <br />
Down in the Rising Sun <br />
 <br />
There is a house in New Orleans <br />
They call the Rising Sun <br />
It's been the ruin of many a-poor boy <br />
And me&#x2013;oh, God&#x2013;I'm one <br />
