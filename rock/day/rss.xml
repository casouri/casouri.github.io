*大橋卓弥 - <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1cW411T76y/">ありがとう</a> - *
</p>

<p>
逛bilibili的时候发现的，把我感动坏了。
</p>

<pre class="example">
なまぬるい風に吹かれながら 東京の空眺めてたら
被生涩的风吹拂着 遥望着东京的天空
遠くで暮らしてるあなたの事をふと思い出す 元気ですか?
突然想起在远方生活着的你 现在好吗
夢を追いかけて離れた街 見送ってくれたあの春の日
为追逐梦想而背井离乡 在你目送我离开的那个春日
頼りなかった僕に「後悔だけはしないで」と
你对羽翼未丰的我说了句“但求无悔”
優しい言葉 ぬくもり その笑顔
你那温柔的话语和温暖的笑颜
ずっと覚えてるよ そして忘れないよ
令我永生难忘
今 心からありがとう
衷心地谢谢你
出来が悪くていつも困らせた あなたの涙何度も見た
没用的我 总是惹你流泪
素直になれずに罵声を浴びせた そんな僕でも愛してくれた
你总是责骂 无法坦诚的我 即便如此 你也爱我依旧
今になってやっとその言葉の本当の意味にも気づきました
事到如今 我才终于明白那句话真正的意义
「辛くなったときはいつでも帰っておいで」と
你说：“撑不下去的话，什么时候都可以回来”
いつも僕の味方でいてくれた
你总是站在我这一边
心配かけたこと 支えてくれたこと
为我担心 支持着我
今 心からありがとう
衷心地谢谢你
返しても返しても返しきれない
不管再怎么还 这份情也还不清
この感謝と敬意を伝えたい
只想传达给你 我的感谢和敬意
頼りなかった僕も少し大人になり
当初那个靠不住的我 也多少长大成人了些
今度は僕が支えていきます
这次换我来支撑这个家
そろそろいい年でしょう 楽して暮らしてください
你年纪也大了 就请多享享清福吧
僕ならもう大丈夫だから
我自己一个人也没问题的
あなたの元に生まれ本当によかったと
身为你的子女 真好
今こうして胸を張って言い切れる
现在可以敞开胸怀这样说
あなたの願うような僕になれていますか?
我长成你希望的那个样子了吗
そんな事を考える
我这样想着
今 心からありがとう
衷心地谢谢你

<p>
很爽的LIVE，我是看网络小说的时候知道长渕刚的（《我的女友是声优》，不知道有人看过没www，挺好看的。小说里提到了《蜻蜓》，作者卷后语还提到了半夜听长渕刚 ）。他的LIVE听着眼泪就哗哗流，尤其到了《勇次》。我都不是日本人都这么感动，日本人听了不得泪流满面（确实是），不得了不得了～～

You might come back home, home to me.

Oh you might understand.

I guess I might have done something wrong,
Honey I'd be glad to admit it.
Oh, come on home to me!
Honey maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe yeah.

Well I know that it just doesn't ever seem to matter, baby,
Oh honey, when I go out or what I'm trying to do,
Can't you see I'm still left here
And I'm holding on in needing you.

Please, please, please, please,
Oh won't you reconsider babe.
Now come on, I said come back,
Won't you come back to me!

</p>

<pre class="example">
Johanna drove slowly into the city
The Hudson River all filled with snow
She spied the ring on His Honor's finger
Oh-oh-oh

A thousand years in one piece of silver
She took it from his lily-white hand
Showed no fear she'd seen the thing
In the Young Men's Wing at Sloan-Kettering

Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh

His Honor drove southward seeking exotica
Down to the Pueblo huts of New Mexico
Cut his teeth on turquoise harmonicas
Oh-oh-oh

I saw Johanna down in the subway
She took an apartment in Washington Heights
Half of the ring lies here with me
But the other half's at the bottom of the sea

Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh

Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh

<p>
看Emacs博客的时候看到博主发了些“七月买的音乐”，里面有张Hermine的专辑封面大图。我这么肤浅的人当然立刻就去油管查了。虽然感觉歌曲没有很惊艳，但是之后油管自动排的歌单里有首TV Lovers很棒。

<p>
博客里看到的封面是下面这张。一张唱片如果封面好看，只要里面有一两首感兴趣歌的我就会买orz。封面一般的话就会斟酌一二，不好看的话有好听的歌也很难下决心买（

<b>加藤登紀子 - <a href="https://youtu.be/SrUp0YU11BE">時には昔の話を</a> - 紅の豚 サウンドトラック - 1992</b>
</p>

<p>
加藤登紀子声音温柔厚重，有成熟女性之风韵，小女生轻飘飘的声音根本比不上www 我没过过苦日子，年纪也不大，没有太多回忆往昔的感觉，但听着歌曲倒是有点感受到加藤登紀子对过去的情感和回忆了。看维基百科上说，加藤登紀子也参加过学运，歌词描述的就是那时候的事吧，果然歌词也有勇气和激情。
</p>

<p>
歌词翻译似乎是“莎士比亚书店”。感谢www
</p>
<pre class="example">
时には昔の话をしようか					偶尔也说说昔日吧
通いなれた なじみのあの店				那家经常去的店
マロニエの并木が窓辺に见えてた		窗边可以看到高大的路树
コーヒーを一杯で一日					一杯咖啡度过一日
见えない明日を むやみにさがして		盲目追寻着无法预知的明天
谁もが希望をたくした					每个人都怀抱希望
ゆれていた时代の热い风にふかれて		动荡时代的热风正吹袭着
体中で瞬间を感じた そうだね			是啊，身体瞬间感受到它
道端で眠ったこともあったね			曾在街头睡过吧
どこにも行けない みんなで				哪里也去不成，每个人
お金はなくても なんとか生きてた		一贫如洗却也活下来
贫しさが明日を运んだ					让贫穷迎来了明天
小さな下宿屋にいく人もおしかけ		小小客栈挤满了流浪的人
朝まで騒いで眠った						喧闹到天明然后入睡
岚のように毎日が燃えていた			每天都像风暴一样燃烧着
息がきれるまで走った そうだね			是的，直到咽下最后的气息

一枚残った写真をごらんよ				看看仅剩的那一张照片
ひげづらの男は君だね					满脸胡须的男人是你吧
どこにいるのか今ではわからない		不知道你现在何方
友达もいく人かいるけど					朋友中已经有人先走了
あの日のすべてが空しいものだと		往日的一切都已成空
それは谁にも言えない					然而对谁也不想说
今でも同じように见果てぬ梦を描いて	到今天仍然怀抱无尽梦想
走りつづけているよね どこかで			不管去哪里， 只知道前进没有止息

虽然没有Janis Joplin那么震撼，但是也几乎不遑多让了。

<pre class="example">
I heard church bells ringing
I heard a choir singing
I saw my love walk down the aisle
On her finger he placed a ring

Oh, I saw them holding hands
She was standing there with my man
I heard them promise "Till death do us part"
Each word was a pain in my heart

All I could do, all I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry)
All I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry)
I was losing the man that I loved
And all I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry)

Yeah and now the wedding's over
Rice, rice has been thrown over their heads
For them life has just begun
But mine is at an end

All, all I could do, all I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry)
All I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry)
I was losing the man that I loved (cry, cry, cry)
And all I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry)

歌词太神，对肆意妄为的女人无可奈何的心情描述地淋漓尽致。作者太懂了吧……
</p>

<pre class="example">
Sometimes I feel so happy
Sometimes I feel so sad
Sometimes I feel so happy
But mostly you just make me mad
Baby, you just make me mad

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

Thought of you as my mountaintop
Thought of you as my peak
Thought of you as everything
I've had, but couldn't keep
I've had, but couldn't keep

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

If I could make the world as pure
And strange as what I see
I'd put you in a mirror
I put in front of me
I put in front of me

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

Skip a life completely
Stuff it in a cup
She said "money is like us in time
It lies, but can't stand up"
Down for you is up

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

It was good what we did yesterday
And I'd do it once again
The fact that you are married
Only proves you're my best friend
But it's truly, truly a sin

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

</p>

<p>
终于有个摇滚推荐了，感动不感动ww Superfly的主唱是越智志帆，唱功了得。本身也喜欢经典摇滚，所以她的歌我也喜欢。链接的是东京武道馆的演唱会。大姐蹦蹦跳跳又很酷，台风超棒。后面和声小姐巨开心地蹦蹦跳跳也很可爱。DVD里还包括一个小影片，讲她去美国和Big Brother and Holding Company一起，在Woodstock四十周年演唱会上唱Janis Joplin的歌。Janis Joplin据她说是她的第一偶像，姐姐好眼光。这姐姐喜欢一首歌唱完紧跟一句thank youuuu，超酷。
</p>

<p>
之前好像喉咙有恙休息了一段时间，休息完就剪了短发，看她后面的演出感觉声音变薄了。希望她能恢复精力，变回那个活力四射的大姐。
</p>

<p>
唯一想吐槽的地方是她的专辑封面都不咋样，Warner Music该打。

時々人の心の中が
信じられない出来事がある
皆　自分だけ逃げてしまおうと
愛を傷つけて通り抜ける
SOMEDAY　一人じゃなくなり
SOMEDAY　何かが見つかる
淋しげに夜の街一人きり歩けば
本当の悲しみを知っている人に会う
二度と会えない素直な愛に
さよならをする人など居ない
だからいつまでも顔を曇らせ
つらい日を送る事はない
SOMEDAY　一人じゃなくなり
SOMEDAY　何かが見つかる
めまいするほど速い毎日の時の波
押し寄せて流される冷たそうな人の海
だけどいつまでも顔を曇らせ
つらい日を送ることはない
SOMEDAY　一人じゃなくなり
SOMEDAY　何かが見つかる

其实这才是2020年第一首听到的有意思的歌。之前都是积压物。这首歌让我感觉City Pop也不错嘛www。这首歌看起来像是著名作品，不然油管也不会推荐给我，搜索“大贯妙子”的时候自动补全出来的也是“4am”。另外，我承认是被封面吸引进去的，这张封面真的很吸引人。绝不是因为我对高领毛衣的特殊喜好，不过大概这种特殊的感觉也只有高领毛衣能体现？

'Cause there's nobody who cares about me
I'm just as blue as blue could be
Always get that mood indigo

按理应该截一张主唱特写，但是这个封面也很酷，就决定是它了！

<p>
又是油管推荐，油管经常给我惊喜www 这首歌很有趣，可能是我不懂，但感觉什么元素都有：大乐团爵士，即兴，灵魂乐，新奥尔良爵士，流行，甚至还有点说唱。

还有<a href="https://youtu.be/H0oEWFPVgKk">第二季的ED</a>，也很不错。ED结束的时候，长大的大野面带笑容的样子让人感到幸福。让我有一种，“啊，她最后过上了幸福的生活”的安心感。

两个主唱的同一首曲子。说起来我第一个听到的这个乐团的曲子就是Alba Armengou的这首Meditaçao。然后发现是A.C.Jobim的作品。Antonio，Carlos和Jobim是星际牛仔里的三人组，我久仰大名。

</p>

<p>
主唱Alba Armengou不光声音吸引人，长相也可爱。有评论说她的声音sweet &amp; smoky，我深以为然，特别是低音上。编曲也明白这点，给她的歌曲都有可以发挥的低音段落。一开始我以为“crazy hue”是“crazy heel”，还说这姑娘发音好有感觉（很懂嘛）www。吹萨克斯的老爷爷和弹钢琴的小哥也很棒，只不过没有主唱可爱，这里就不多说了。
</p>

<p>
这个表演缺了一个关键的东西，显得不大完整：没有观众的欢呼。结束的时候每次都感觉少了东西。有的人可能喜欢“干净”的表演，但果然没有观众的欢呼互动就没有感觉啊。
</p>

<p>
最近听了不少爵士曲子，之后还有几首想要分享。

<pre class="example">
Those silk shiny stockings
That I wear when I'm with you
I wear 'cause you told me
That you dig that crazy hue

Do we feel the romance
When we go to the dance
Oh no, you take a glance
At those shiny stockings

Then came along some chick
With great big stockings, too
When you changed your mind about me
Why, I never knew

I guess I'll have to find
A new, a new kind
A guy who digs my shiny stockings, too

<p>
有点色情www
</p>

<pre class="example">
Taxi, taxi

Lady cab driver, can you take me for a ride?
Don't know where I'm goin' 'cause I don't know where I've been
So just put your foot on the gas, let's drive
Lady, don't ask questions
Promise I'll tell you no lies
Trouble winds are blowin', I'm growin' cold
Get me outta here, I feel I'm gonna die

Lady cab driver, roll up your window fast
Lately trouble winds are blowin' hard, and I don't know if I can last

Lady, I'm so lonely
I know that's not the way to be
Don't want isolation, but the air it makes me cold
Drive it, baby, drive it, drive this demon out of me
Take me to your mansion
Honey, let's go everywhere
Help me girl I'm drownin', mass confusion in my head
Will you accept my tears to pay the fare?

Lady cab driver, roll up your window fast
Lately trouble winds are blowin' hard, and I don't know if I can last oh, oh

Lady cab driver, can you take me for a ride?

Lady cab driver, roll up your window fast
Lately trouble winds are blowin' hard, and I don't know if I can last

This is for the cab you have to drive for no money at all
This is for why I wasn't born like my brother, handsome and tall
This is for politicians who are bored and believe in war
This, yeah, that's for me, that's who that one's for
This is for discrimination and egotists who think supreme
And this is for whoever taught you how to kiss in designer jeans
That one's for, that one's for, for you have to live
This one's for the rich, not all of 'em, just the greedy,
The ones that don't know how to give
This one's for Yosemite Sam and the tourists at Disneyland
And this one oh yeah, that's the one
That's for that's for the, the creator of man
This is for the sun, the moon, the stars, the tourists at Disneyland
This is for the ocean, the sea, the shore
This is for and that's for you, and that's who that one's for
This is for the women, so beautifully complex
This one's for love without sex
This is for the wind that blows no matter how fast or slow
Not knowing where I'm going
This galaxy's better than not having a place to go
And now I know (I know)

<pre class="example">
Boards on the window, mail by the door
What would anybody leave so quickly for?
Ophelia - Where have you gone?

The old neighborhood just ain't the same
Nobody knows just what became of
Ophelia - tell me, what went wrong?

Was it somethin' that somebody said?
Mama, I know we broke the rules
Was somebody up against the law?
Honey, you know I'd die for you

Ashes of laughter, the coast is clear
Why do the best things always disappear
Like Ophelia - please darken my door

Was it somethin' that somebody said?
Honey, you know we broke the rules
Was somebody up against the law?
Honey, you know I'd die for you

They got your number, scared and runnin'
But I'm still waitin' for the second comin'
Of Ophelia - come back home

You got women, you got women on your mind
Have a drink, have a drive
Go out and see what you can find

If her daddy's poor just do what you feel
Speed along the lane
Do a turn or return the twenty-five

You can make it, make it good and really fine

We're not bad people

We love everybody but we do as we please

Chh chh-chh, uh, chh chh-chh

In the summertime when the weather is hot
You can stretch right up and touch the sky
When the weather's fine
You got women, you got women on your mind
Have a drink, have a drive
Go out and see what you can find

If her daddy's rich take her out for a meal
If her daddy's poor just do what you feel
Speed along the lane
Do a turn or return the twenty-five
When the sun goes down
You can make it, make it good and really fine

We're not bad people
We're not dirty, we're not mean
We love everybody but we do as we please
When the weather's fine
We go fishin' or go swimmin' in the sea
We're always happy
Life's for livin' yeah, that's our philosophy

Sing along with us
Dee dee dee-dee dee
Dah dah dah-dah dah
Yeah we're hap-happy
Dah dah-dah
Dee-dah-do dee-dah-do dah-do-dah
Dah-do-dah-dah-dah

<p>
晚上的时候，听着这首曲子，看着龙伴随着点点星光从水中 不急不徐的飞出来。我真的感到宁静和祥和，并且发自内心的对这个生物感到崇敬。如果真的有龙的话，一定是这样的吧。我止不住想像千百年前的祖先第一次看到如此强大和美好的存在，把它作为部落的图腾的场景。

<b>Kaleo - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXsK_u4ixI">I Can't Go on Without You</a></b>
</p>

<p>
这首歌是1948年Bull Moose Jackson的单曲，链接里的是经由Kaleo改编后的现场演出。相对于他们专辑里的版本，我更喜欢这首。这首更加过渡更平滑自然，专辑里的版本感觉稍微有点快。
</p>

<p>
Kaleo是一支来自冰岛，有蓝调背景的摇滚乐队。他们有一些超级酷的现场演出：在浮冰，火山口这些地方！我比较好奇的是他们的手指不会冻僵么……在浮冰上演出的时候。
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUY8XtieKLQ">Bull Moose Jackson的版本</a>也很有意思。

<p>
皇后乐队的音乐总能给人一种归属感，让人情不自禁的加入进去。他们大部分最受欢迎的歌都是这样。我想这也是Freddie Mercury无与伦比的舞台掌控力的一个因素。

Can anybody find me somebody to love?

Ooh, each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
(Take a look at yourself) Take a look in the mirror and cry (and cry)

They call me the wanderer
Yeah, the wanderer
I roam around, around, around

Oh well, there's Flo on my left and then there's Mary on my right

And when she asks me, which one I love the best?
I tear open my shirt and I show "Rosie" on my chest

Cause I'm the wanderer
Yeah, the wanderer
I roam around, around, around

Oh well, I roam from town to town
I go through life without a care
And I'm as happy as a clown
I with my two fists of iron but I'm going nowhere

Oh yeah, I’m the type of guy that likes to roam around
I’m never in one place, I roam from town to town

挺伤心的一首歌。
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Hard_Rain%2527s_a-Gonna_Fall">Wiki</a>
</p>

<pre class="example">
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin'
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman whose body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded with hatred
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

Oh, what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, what'll you do now, my darling young one?
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
Where the executioner's face is always well-hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number
And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'
But I'll know my song well before I start singin'
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

</p>

<p>
听完Janis的歌会有疲惫感，好像你也像她一样用灵魂燃烧了五分钟。
</p>

<pre class="example">
Cry baby, cry baby, cry baby
Honey, welcome back home

I know she told you
Honey, I know she told you that she loved you
Much more than I did
But all I know is that she left you
And you swear that you just don't know why
But you know, honey I'll always
I'll always be around
If you ever want me
Come on and cry, cry baby
Cry baby, cry baby
Oh honey, welcome back home

Don't you know
Honey, ain't nobody ever gonna love you
The way I try to do? 
Who'll take all your pain
Honey, your heartache, too? 
And if you need me, you know
That I'll always be around
If you ever want me
Come on and cry, cry baby
Cry baby, cry baby
Oh daddy, like you always saying to do

And when you're walkin' around the world, babe
You said you'd try to look for the end of the road
You might find out later that the road'll end in Detroit
Honey, the road'll even end in Kathmandu
You can go all around the world
Trying to find something to do with your life, baby
When you only gotta do one thing well
You only gotta do one thing well to make it in this world, babe
You got a woman waiting for you there
All you ever gotta do is be a good man one time to one woman
And that'll be the end of the road, babe
I know you got more tears to share, babe
So come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
And cry, cry baby
Cry baby, cry

And if you ever feel a little lonely, dear
I want you to come on, come on to your mama now
And if you ever want a little love of a woman
Come on and baby, baby, baby, babe, babe, baby now
Cry baby yeah

</p>

<p>
我一直觉得这首歌有浓重的中国风格，滚石也提到这首歌受东亚风格影响，不过他（Mick Jagger）觉得是印度音乐影响。不管他怎么想，对我来说这首歌字里行间全是中国曲调。尤其是“just about a moonlight mile”那段。音乐里听来的这种感觉模模糊糊，描述不出来，只能大概感觉到元宵节万家灯火的那种和美的温馨。并不喧闹，是从远处高空看到星星点点的火光的安静的温馨。
</p>

<pre class="example">
When the wind blows and the rain feels cold 
With a head full of snow, with a head full of snow 
In the window, there's a face you know 
Don't the night pass slow? Don't the nights pass slow? 

The sound of strangers sending nothing to my mind 
Just another mad, mad day on the road 
I am just living to be lying by your side 
But I'm just about a moonlight mile on down the road 

Made a rag pile of my shiny clothes 
Going to warm my bones, going to warm my bones 
I've got silence on my radio 
Let the air waves flow, let the air waves flow
 
For I am sleeping under strange, strange skies 
Just another mad, mad day on the road 
My dreams is fading down the railway line 
I'm just about a moonlight mile on down the road
 
Yeah, yeah 

I'm hiding, sister, and I'm dreaming 
I'm riding down your moonlight mile 
I'm hiding, baby, but I'm dreaming 
I'm riding down your moonlight mile
I'm riding down your moonlight mile
 
Let it go now
Come on up, baby 
Yeah, let it go now
Yeah 
Flow now, baby
Yeah, come on now, yeah 

Hey 

Yeah I'm coming home 
Cause I'm just about a moonlight mile on down the road
On down the road, on down the road 
Yeah, yeah baby

</p>

<p>
我第一次听到这首歌是在《战争之王》里，是电影的片头曲。
</p>

<pre class="example">
There's something happening here
What it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
Telling me I got to beware

I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

There's battle lines being drawn
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong
Young people speaking their minds
Getting so much resistance from behind

It's time we stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

What a field-day for the heat
A thousand people in the street
Singing songs and carrying signs
Mostly say, hooray for our side

It's s time we stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
You step out of line, the man come and take you away

We better stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Stop, now, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Stop, children, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

<p>
我前几天在学校食堂的广播里听到的这首歌www
</p>

<pre class="example">
We get it almost every night
When that moon is big and bright
It's a supernatural delight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight

Everybody here is out of sight
They don't bark, and they don't bite
They keep things loose, they keep 'em tight
Everybody was dancin' in the moonlight

Dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' warm and bright
It's such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight

We like our fun and we never fight
You can't dance and stay uptight
It's a supernatural delight
Everybody was dancin' in the moonlight

Dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' warm and bright
It's such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight

We get it almost every night
When that moon is big and bright
It's a supernatural delight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight

Dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' warm and bright
It's such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight

Dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' warm and bright
It's such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight

Dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' warm and bright
It's such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight

Dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' warm and bright
It's such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight

Dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' warm and bright
It's such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight

"You Can't Always Get What You Want" was recorded on 16 and 17 November 1968 at Olympic Sound Studios in London. It features the London Bach Choir opening the song (the choir opening is only on the album version), highlighting throughout, and bringing it to its conclusion.

<pre class="example">
I saw her today at the reception
A glass of wine in her hand
I knew she would meet her connection
At her feet was her footloose man

No, you can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometime you find
You get what you need

I saw her today at the reception

You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes you might find
You get what you need

But I went down to the demonstration
To get your fair share of abuse
Singing, "We're gonna vent our frustration
If we don't we're gonna blow a fifty-amp fuse"

You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes well you just might find
You get what you need

I went down to the Chelsea drugstore
To get your prescription filled
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy
And man, did he look pretty ill
We decided that we would have a soda
My favorite flavor, cherry red
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy
Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was "dead"
I said to him

You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes you just might find
You get what you need

You get what you need, yeah, oh baby

I saw her today at the reception
In her glass was a bleeding man
She was practiced at the art of deception
Well I could tell by her blood-stained hands

You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes you just might find
You just might find
You get what you need

You can't always get what you want

But if you try sometimes you just might find

<b>Lynyrd Skynyrd - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSvKkMs2ieo">The Ballad of Curtis Loew</a> - 1974</b>
</p>

<pre class="example">
Well, I used to wake the mornin'
Before the rooster crowed
Searchin' for soda bottles
To get myself some dough
Brought 'em down to the corner
Down to the country store
Cash 'em in, and give my money
To a man named Curtis Loew

Old Curt was a black man
With white curly hair
When he had a fifth of wine
He did not have a care
He used to own an old Dobro
Used to play it 'cross his knee
I'd give old Curt my money
He'd play all day for me

Play me a song
Curtis Loew, Curtis Loew
Well, I got your drinkin' money
Tune up your Dobro
People said he was useless
Them people all were fools
'Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker
To ever play the blues

He looked to be sixty
And maybe I was ten
Mama used to whoop me
But I'd go see him again
I'd clap my hands, stomp my feet
Try to stay in time
He'd play me a song or two
Then take another drink of wine

Play me a song
Curtis Loew, Curtis Loew
Well, I got your drinkin' money
Tune up your Dobro
People said he was useless
Them people all were fools
'Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker
To ever play the blues

Yes, sir

On the day old Curtis died
Nobody came to pray
Ol' preacher said some words
And they chunked him in the clay
Well, he lived a lifetime
Playin' the black man's blues
And on the day he lost his life
That's all he had to lose

Play me a song
Curtis Loew, hey Curtis Loew
I wish that you was here so
Everyone would know
People said he was useless
Them people all were fools
'Cause Curtis you're the finest picker
To ever play the blues

<pre class="example">
[Verse 1]
It was twenty years ago today
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Bridge]
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's wonderful to be here
It's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home

[Verse 2]
I don't really want to stop the show
But I thought you might like to know
That the singer's going to sing a song
And he wants you all to sing along
So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

<b>With A Little Help From My Friends</b>
</p>

<pre class="example">
[Segue: The Beatles]
Billy Shears!

[Verse 1: Ringo Starr]
What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key

[Chorus: Ringo Starr]
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends

[Verse 2: Ringo Starr &amp; The Beatles]
What do I do when my love is away?
Does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day?
Are you sad because you're on your own?

[Chorus: Ringo Starr]
No, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends

[Bridge: Ringo Starr &amp; The Beatles]
Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love


[Verse 3: Ringo Starr &amp; The Beatles]
Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine

[Chorus: Ringo Starr]
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, get high with a little help from my friends
Oh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

[Bridge: Ringo Starr &amp; The Beatles]
Do you need anybody?
I just need someone to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love

[Outro: Ringo Starr]
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends
Oh, I get high with a little help from my friends
Yes, I get by with a little help from my friends
With a little help from my friends

Childhood living is easy to do.
The things you wanted
I bought them for you.
Graceless lady
you know how I am
you know I can't let you
slide through my hands.

Wild horses
couldn't drag me away.
Wild, wild horses
couldn't drag me away.

I watched you suffer
a dull aching pain.
Now you decided to
show me the same.
But no sweeping exits or offstage lines
could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind.

Wild Horses
couldn't drag me away.
Wild, wild horses
couldn't drag me away.

I know I've dreamed you a sin and a lie
I have my freedom but I don't have much time
Faith has been broken tears must be cried
Let's do some living after we die

Wild Horses
couldn't drag me away.
Wild, wild horses
couldn't drag me away.

Wild Horses
couldn't drag me away.
Wild, wild horses
we'll ride them some day

Went to Pére Lachaise in Paris to see Jim Morrison's grave last September, all of a sudden this Australian dude rocks up in full leather gear, blaring this song as loud as he possibly could, barging through the small crowd. Everybody, I mean EVERYBODY is staring at him, and he just shouts "What? It's appropriate!" I never laughed so hard in a cemetery. I still think of that guy sometimes.﻿

So this was all boiling inside of me and I sat down on the edge of my bed and out came "It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no senator's son!" You know, it took about 20 minutes to write the song.

Some folks are born made to wave the flag
Ooh, they're red, white and blue
And when the band plays "Hail to the chief"
Ooh, they point the cannon at you, Lord
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no senator's son, son
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, no

Some folks are born silver spoon in hand
Lord, don't they help themselves, oh
But when the taxman comes to the door
Lord, the house looks like a rummage sale, yes
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no millionaire's son, no
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, no

Some folks inherit star spangled eyes
Ooh, they send you down to war, Lord
And when you ask them, "How much should we give?"
Ooh, they only answer "More! More! More!" y'all

It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no military son, son
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, one

It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, no no no
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate son, no no no

<blockquote>
<p>
这是一首传统民谣，也叫日晟蓝调。讲述了一个人在新奥尔良的悲惨生活，很多版本中还告诫兄弟姐妹不要不要重蹈覆辙。
</p>

<p>
An interview with Eric Burdon revealed that he first heard the song in a club in Newcastle, England, where it was sung by the Northumbrian folk singer Johnny Handle. The Animals were on tour with Chuck Berry and chose it because they wanted something distinctive to sing.

<pre class="example">
There is a house down in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun.
And it's been the ruin of many a-poor boy
And me--oh, God--I'm one

My mother was a tailor
She sewed these new blue jeans
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord
Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

He fills his glasses up to the brim
And he'll pass the cards around
And the only pleasure he gets out of life
Is ramblin' from town to town

Oh, tell my baby sister
Not to do what I have done!
But shun that house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun

Well it's one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train!
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain


I'm a goin' back to New Orleans
My race is almost run!
I'm goin' back to end my life
Down in the Rising Sun

There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
It's been the ruin of many a-poor boy
And me--oh, God--I'm one

Didn't I make you feel
Like you were the only man, yeah
Didn't I give you everything that a woman possibly can?
But with all the love I give ya
It's never enough
But I'm gonna show you, baby, that a woman can be tough
So come on, come on, come on, come on
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby!
Break it!
Break another little bit of my heart now, honey
Have a!
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
You know you got it if it makes you feel good
You're out on the street (looking good)
And you know deep down in your heart that it ain't right
And ah, you never, never hear me when I cry at night
And oh oh I, I tell myself that I can't stand the pain
But when you hold me in your arms, I say it again
So come on, come on, come on, come on
And take it!
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby!
Hey, break it!
Break another little bit of my heart now, baby
You can have a!
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
You know you got it if it makes you feel good
Hey, hey
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby!
Oh, break it!
Break another little bit of my heart now, honey
Hey, have a!
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
Come on, take it!

Angie, Angie
When will those clouds all disappear?
Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here?
With no loving in our soul
And no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied
But Angie, Angie
You can't say we never tried
Angie, you're beautiful
But ain't it time we said goodbye?
Angie, I still love you
Remember all those nights we cried?
All the dreams we held so close
Seemed to all go up in smoke
Let me whisper in your ear
Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here?

Oh, Angie, don't you weep
All your kisses still taste sweet
I hate that sadness in your eyes
Angie, Angie
Ain't it time we said goodbye?
Angie, Angie
Ain't it time we said goodbye?
With no loving in our souls
And no money in our coats
You can't say were satisfied
But Angie, I still love you, Baby
Everywhere I look I see your eyes
There ain't a woman that comes close to you
Come on Baby, dry your eyes
But Angie, Angie
Ain't it good to be alive?
Angie, Angie
They can't say we never tried

<b>Joan Chamorro Presenta &amp; Alba Armengou - <a href="https://youtu.be/kP_z6NFJXBU">I Feel Pretty</a></b>
</p>

<p>
这首歌歌词很可爱。编曲也很有新意，我听了听之前的版本，节奏都慢很多。相比之下这个编排我更喜欢。跟之前那个“crazy hue”一样，这首歌里也有个词我感觉主唱发得很有意思www，只不过忘了是哪个了。以后有时间再补吧。

I feel pretty
Oh, so pretty
I feel pretty and witty and bright!
And I pity
Any girl who isn't me tonight

I feel charming
Oh, so charming
It's alarming how charming I feel!
And so pretty
That I hardly can believe I'm real

See the pretty girl in that mirror there
Who can that attractive girl be?
Such a pretty face
Such a pretty dress
Such a pretty smile
Such a pretty me!

I feel stunning
And entrancing
Feel like running and dancing for joy
For I'm loved
By a pretty wonderful boy!
