<p>
<b>Janis Joplin - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=janis+joplin+a+woman+left+lonely">A Woman Left Lonely</a> - Pearl - 1971</b>
</p>

<p>
又失恋了，环视一圈居然没有人能倾诉，或者说，我想倾诉吗？这次居然没有两年前一样的痛苦，大概这两年间被幸福这把warm gun枪杀了一次又一次，我的神经已经麻木了。虽然不是完全符合，但是这是我现在想到最近的一首歌。一首​<i>A Woman Left Lonely</i>​送给大家。
</p>

<hr/><div class="lyrics">
<p>
A woman left lonely will soon grow tired of waiting, <br />
She'll do crazy things, yeah, on lonely occasions. <br />
A simple conversation for the new men now and again <br />
Makes a touchy situation when a good face come into your head. <br />
And when she gets lonely, she's thinking 'bout her man, <br />
She knows he's taking her for granted, yeah yeah, <br />
Honey, she doesn't understand, no no no no!  <br />
 <br />
Well, the fevers of the night, they burn an unloved woman <br />
Yeah, those red-hot flames try to push old love aside. <br />
A woman left lonely, she's the victim of her man, yes she is. <br />
When he can't keep up his own way, good Lord, <br />
She's got to do the best that she can, yeah! <br />
A woman left lonely, Lord, that lonely girl, <br />
Lord, Lord, Lord! <br />
</p>
</div>

<p>
P.S. 给大家一个经验，如果一个人一开始不喜欢你，天天聊天聊两年也不会变得喜欢你，所以不要挣扎了，接受现实。当然，大概没人真的能失望至极之前放弃。
</p>

<p>
P.P.S 上周刚买到口琴的时候学了个调很高兴地准备分享给她炫耀，最后因为各种原因没有没机会发。现在放到这里吧。

<p>
<b>Beatles - <a href="https://youtu.be/vdvnOH060Qg">Happiness Is A Warm Gun</a> - The Beatles - 1968</b>
</p>

<p>
我不太明白歌词的意思，也不明白歌词和我的心情有什么重合，但昨晚的我莫名觉得这首歌很符合自己的心情。“Happiness Is A Warm Gun”，真神奇，John Lennon和我没有任何共同点，没有相似的成长环境、人生历程。他写歌词时想到的含义、他当时的心情一定和我大相径庭，但是他1968年演奏的歌词和曲调能却能和昨晚的我产生极大共鸣。
</p>

<p>
John Lennon vs Paul McCartney rant：Lennon的歌词曲调似乎是更能产生共鸣，更真实。
</p>

<hr/><div class="lyrics">

<p>
She's not a girl who misses much <br />
Do do do do do do do do, oh yeah <br />
She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand <br />
Like a lizard on a window pane <br />
The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors <br />
On his hobnail boots <br />
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy <br />
Working overtime <br />
A soap impression of his wife which he ate <br />
And donated to the National Trust <br />
 <br />
Down <br />
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down <br />
Down to the bits that I left uptown <br />
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down <br />

Mother Superior jump the gun <br />
Mother Superior jump the gun <br />
Mother Superior jump the gun <br />
Mother Superior jump the gun <br />
Mother Superior jump the gun <br />
Mother Superior jump the gun <br />
 <br />
Happiness is a warm gun (Happiness bang, bang, shoot, shoot) <br />
Happiness is a warm gun, mama (Happiness bang, bang, shoot, shoot) <br />
When I hold you in my arms (Oo-oo oh yeah) <br />
And I feel my finger on your trigger (Oo-oo oh yeah) <br />
I know nobody can do me no harm (Oo-oo oh yeah) <br />
 <br />
Because happiness is a warm gun, mama (Happiness bang, bang, shoot, shoot) <br />
Happiness is a warm gun, yes it is (Happiness bang, bang, shoot, shoot) <br />
Happiness is a warm, yes it is, gun (Happiness bang, bang, shoot, shoot) <br />
Well, don't you know that happiness is a warm gun, mama? (Happiness is a warm gun, yeah) <br />

<b>Vamprie Weekend - <a href="https://youtu.be/XwJQlUQjeS4">I Think Ur A Contra</a> -  Contra - 2010</b>
</p>

<p>
之前说的封面好看想买的专辑，音乐意外地不错。其中我最喜欢的就是这首结尾曲。一直搞不清楚contra是什么意思，问了朋友，结论是有反叛精神之人的意思，大概）
</p>


<hr/><div class="lyrics">
<p>
I had a feeling once <br />
That you and I <br />
Could tell each other everything <br />
For two months <br />
 <br />
But even with an oath <br />
With truth on our side <br />
When you turn away from me <br />
It's not right <br />
 <br />
I think you're a Contra <br />
I think you're a Contra <br />
I think you're a Contra <br />
I think you're a Contra <br />
 <br />
My revolution thoughts <br />
Your little arrows of desire <br />
I want to trace them to the source <br />
And the wire <br />
 <br />
But it's not useful now <br />
Since we've both made up our minds <br />
You're going to watch out for yourself <br />
And so will I <br />
 <br />
I think you're a Contra <br />
And I think that you've lied <br />
Don't call me a Contra <br />
Til you've tried <br />
 <br />
You wanted good schools <br />
And friends with pools <br />
You're not a Contra <br />
 <br />
You wanted Rock and Roll <br />
Complete control <br />
Well, I don't know <br />
 <br />
Never pick sides <br />
Never choose between two <br />
But I just wanted you <br />
I just wanted you <br />
 <br />
You said, "Never pick sides <br />
Never choose between two" <br />
But I just wanted you <br />
I just wanted you <br />
 <br />
I think you're a Contra <br />
And I think that you've lied <br />
Don't call me a Contra <br />
Til you've tried <br />

知乎上看到的，整张专辑都很棒。左轮的声音很有趣，​<i>The Gumbo Variations</i>​里的萨克斯和小提琴独奏也很精彩。

I'm a little pimp with my hair gassed back <br />
Pair a khaki pants with my shoe shined black <br />

Got a little lady&#x2026; walk the street <br />
Tellin' all the boys that she can't be beat <br />
 <br />
Twenny dollah bill (I can set you straight) <br />
Meet me onna corner boy 'n don't be late <br />

Man in a suit with a bow-tie neck <br />
Wanna buy a grunt with a third party check <br />

Standin' onna porch of the Lido Hotel <br />

<b>大橋卓弥 - <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1cW411T76y/" lang="ja">ありがとう</a> - 2008</b>
</p>

<p>
逛bilibili的时候发现的，把我感动坏了。
</p>

<div class="hcontainer">
<div lang="ja">

<hr/><div class="lyrics">
<p>
なまぬるい風に吹かれながら 東京の空眺めてたら <br />
遠くで暮らしてるあなたの事をふと思い出す 元気ですか? <br />
夢を追いかけて離れた街 見送ってくれたあの春の日 <br />
頼りなかった僕に「後悔だけはしないで」と <br />
優しい言葉 ぬくもり その笑顔 <br />
ずっと覚えてるよ そして忘れないよ <br />
今 心からありがとう <br />
出来が悪くていつも困らせた あなたの涙何度も見た <br />
素直になれずに罵声を浴びせた そんな僕でも愛してくれた <br />
今になってやっとその言葉の本当の意味にも気づきました <br />
「辛くなったときはいつでも帰っておいで」と <br />
いつも僕の味方でいてくれた <br />
心配かけたこと 支えてくれたこと <br />
今 心からありがとう <br />
返しても返しても返しきれない <br />
この感謝と敬意を伝えたい <br />
頼りなかった僕も少し大人になり <br />
今度は僕が支えていきます <br />
そろそろいい年でしょう 楽して暮らしてください <br />
僕ならもう大丈夫だから <br />
あなたの元に生まれ本当によかったと <br />
今こうして胸を張って言い切れる <br />
あなたの願うような僕になれていますか? <br />
そんな事を考える <br />
今 心からありがとう <br />
</p>

<hr/><div class="lyrics">
<p>
被生涩的风吹拂着 遥望着东京的天空 <br />
突然想起在远方生活着的你 现在好吗 <br />
为追逐梦想而背井离乡 在你目送我离开的那个春日 <br />
你对羽翼未丰的我说了句“但求无悔” <br />
你那温柔的话语和温暖的笑颜 <br />
令我永生难忘 <br />
衷心地谢谢你 <br />
没用的我 总是惹你流泪 <br />
你总是责骂 无法坦诚的我 即便如此 你也爱我依旧 <br />
事到如今 我才终于明白那句话真正的意义 <br />
你说：“撑不下去的话，什么时候都可以回来” <br />
你总是站在我这一边 <br />
为我担心 支持着我 <br />
衷心地谢谢你 <br />
不管再怎么还 这份情也还不清 <br />
只想传达给你 我的感谢和敬意 <br />
当初那个靠不住的我 也多少长大成人了些 <br />
这次换我来支撑这个家 <br />
你年纪也大了 就请多享享清福吧 <br />
我自己一个人也没问题的 <br />
身为你的子女 真好 <br />
现在可以敞开胸怀这样说 <br />
我长成你希望的那个样子了吗 <br />
我这样想着 <br />
衷心地谢谢你 <br />

很爽的LIVE，我是看网络小说的时候知道长渕刚的（《我的女友是声优》，不知道有人看过没www，挺好看的。小说里提到了《蜻蜓》，作者卷后语还提到了半夜听长渕刚 ）。他的LIVE听着眼泪就哗哗流，尤其到了《勇次》。我都不是日本人都这么感动，日本人听了不得泪流满面（确实是），不得了不得了～～

<p>
Johanna drove slowly into the city <br />
The Hudson River all filled with snow <br />
She spied the ring on His Honor's finger <br />
Oh-oh-oh <br />
 <br />
A thousand years in one piece of silver <br />
She took it from his lily-white hand <br />
Showed no fear she'd seen the thing <br />
In the Young Men's Wing at Sloan-Kettering <br />
 <br />
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh <br />
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh <br />
 <br />
His Honor drove southward seeking exotica <br />
Down to the Pueblo huts of New Mexico <br />
Cut his teeth on turquoise harmonicas <br />
Oh-oh-oh <br />
 <br />
I saw Johanna down in the subway <br />
She took an apartment in Washington Heights <br />
Half of the ring lies here with me <br />
But the other half's at the bottom of the sea <br />
 <br />
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh <br />
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh <br />

Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh <br />

加藤登紀子声音温柔厚重，有成熟女性之风韵，小女生轻飘飘的声音根本比不上www 我没过过苦日子，年纪也不大，没有太多回忆往昔的感觉，但听着歌曲倒是有点感受到加藤登紀子对过去的情感和回忆了。看维基百科上说，加藤登紀子也参加过学运，歌词描述的就是那时候的事吧，果然歌词也有勇气和激情。

时には昔の话をしようか <br />
通いなれた なじみのあの店 <br />
マロニエの并木が窓辺に见えてた <br />
コーヒーを一杯で一日 <br />
见えない明日を むやみにさがして <br />
谁もが希望をたくした <br />
ゆれていた时代の热い风にふかれて <br />
体中で瞬间を感じた そうだね <br />
道端で眠ったこともあったね <br />
どこにも行けない みんなで <br />
お金はなくても なんとか生きてた <br />
贫しさが明日を运んだ <br />
小さな下宿屋にいく人もおしかけ <br />
朝まで騒いで眠った <br />
岚のように毎日が燃えていた <br />
息がきれるまで走った そうだね <br />
 <br />
一枚残った写真をごらんよ <br />
ひげづらの男は君だね <br />
どこにいるのか今ではわからない <br />
友达もいく人かいるけど <br />
あの日のすべてが空しいものだと <br />
それは谁にも言えない <br />
今でも同じように见果てぬ梦を描いて <br />
走りつづけているよね どこかで <br />

<p>
偶尔也说说昔日吧 <br />
那家经常去的店 <br />
窗边可以看到高大的路树 <br />
一杯咖啡度过一日 <br />
盲目追寻着无法预知的明天 <br />
每个人都怀抱希望 <br />
动荡时代的热风正吹袭着 <br />
是啊，身体瞬间感受到它 <br />
曾在街头睡过吧 <br />
哪里也去不成，每个人 <br />
一贫如洗却也活下来 <br />
让贫穷迎来了明天 <br />
小小客栈挤满了流浪的人 <br />
喧闹到天明然后入睡 <br />
每天都像风暴一样燃烧着 <br />
是的，直到咽下最后的气息 <br />
 <br />
看看仅剩的那一张照片 <br />
满脸胡须的男人是你吧 <br />
不知道你现在何方 <br />
朋友中已经有人先走了 <br />
往日的一切都已成空 <br />
然而对谁也不想说 <br />
到今天仍然怀抱无尽梦想 <br />
不管去哪里，只知道前进没有止息 <br />

<b>Etta James - <a href="https://youtu.be/8sMb7QP78Vw">All I Could Do Was Cry</a> - 1960</b>
</p>

<p>
虽然没有Janis Joplin那么震撼，但是也几乎不遑多让了。
</p>

<hr/><div class="lyrics">
<p>
I heard church bells ringing <br />
I heard a choir singing <br />
I saw my love walk down the aisle <br />
On her finger he placed a ring <br />
 <br />
Oh, I saw them holding hands <br />
She was standing there with my man <br />
I heard them promise "Till death do us part" <br />
Each word was a pain in my heart <br />
 <br />
All I could do, all I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry) <br />
All I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry) <br />
I was losing the man that I loved <br />
And all I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry) <br />
 <br />
Yeah and now the wedding's over <br />
Rice, rice has been thrown over their heads <br />
For them life has just begun <br />
But mine is at an end <br />
 <br />
All, all I could do, all I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry) <br />
All I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry) <br />
I was losing the man that I loved (cry, cry, cry) <br />
And all I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry) <br />

</p>

<p>
歌词太神，对肆意妄为的女人无可奈何的心情描述地淋漓尽致。作者太懂了吧……
</p>

<hr/><div class="lyrics">
<p>
Sometimes I feel so happy <br />
Sometimes I feel so sad <br />
Sometimes I feel so happy <br />
But mostly you just make me mad <br />
Baby, you just make me mad <br />
 <br />
Linger on your pale blue eyes <br />
Linger on your pale blue eyes <br />
 <br />
Thought of you as my mountaintop <br />
Thought of you as my peak <br />
Thought of you as everything <br />
I've had, but couldn't keep <br />
I've had, but couldn't keep <br />
 <br />
Linger on your pale blue eyes <br />
Linger on your pale blue eyes <br />
 <br />
If I could make the world as pure <br />
And strange as what I see <br />
I'd put you in a mirror <br />
I put in front of me <br />
I put in front of me <br />
 <br />
Linger on your pale blue eyes <br />
Linger on your pale blue eyes <br />
 <br />
Skip a life completely <br />
Stuff it in a cup <br />
She said "money is like us in time <br />
It lies, but can't stand up" <br />
Down for you is up <br />
 <br />
Linger on your pale blue eyes <br />
Linger on your pale blue eyes <br />
 <br />
It was good what we did yesterday <br />
And I'd do it once again <br />
The fact that you are married <br />
Only proves you're my best friend <br />
But it's truly, truly a sin <br />
 <br />
Linger on your pale blue eyes <br />
Linger on your pale blue eyes <br />

</p>

<p>
终于有个摇滚推荐了，感动不感动ww Superfly的主唱是越智志帆，唱功了得。本身也喜欢经典摇滚，所以她的歌我也喜欢。链接的是东京武道馆的演唱会。大姐蹦蹦跳跳又很酷，台风超棒。后面和声小姐巨开心地蹦蹦跳跳也很可爱。DVD里还包括一个小影片，讲她去美国和Big Brother and Holding Company一起，在Woodstock四十周年演唱会上唱Janis Joplin的歌。Janis Joplin据她说是她的第一偶像，姐姐好眼光。这姐姐喜欢一首歌唱完紧跟一句thank youuuu，超酷。
</p>

<p>
之前好像喉咙有恙休息了一段时间，休息完就剪了短发，看她后面的演出感觉声音变薄了。希望她能恢复精力，变回那个活力四射的大姐。
</p>

<p>
唯一想吐槽的地方是她的专辑封面都不咋样，Warner Music该打。

時々人の心の中が <br />
信じられない出来事がある <br />
皆　自分だけ逃げてしまおうと <br />
愛を傷つけて通り抜ける <br />
SOMEDAY　一人じゃなくなり <br />
SOMEDAY　何かが見つかる <br />
淋しげに夜の街一人きり歩けば <br />
本当の悲しみを知っている人に会う <br />
二度と会えない素直な愛に <br />
さよならをする人など居ない <br />
だからいつまでも顔を曇らせ <br />
つらい日を送る事はない <br />
SOMEDAY　一人じゃなくなり <br />
SOMEDAY　何かが見つかる <br />
めまいするほど速い毎日の時の波 <br />
押し寄せて流される冷たそうな人の海 <br />
だけどいつまでも顔を曇らせ <br />
つらい日を送ることはない <br />

<p>
其实这才是2020年第一首听到的有意思的歌。之前都是积压物。这首歌让我感觉City Pop也不错嘛www。这首歌看起来像是著名作品，不然油管也不会推荐给我，搜索“大贯妙子”的时候自动补全出来的也是“4am”。另外，我承认是被封面吸引进去的，这张封面真的很吸引人。绝不是因为我对高领毛衣的特殊喜好，不过大概这种特殊的感觉也只有高领毛衣能体现？

</p>

<p>
主唱Alba Armengou不光声音吸引人，长相也可爱。有评论说她的声音sweet &amp; smoky，我深以为然，特别是低音上。编曲也明白这点，给她的歌曲都有可以发挥的低音段落。一开始我以为“crazy hue”是“crazy heel”，还说这姑娘发音好有感觉（很懂嘛）www。吹萨克斯的老爷爷和弹钢琴的小哥也很棒，只不过没有主唱可爱，这里就不多说了。
</p>

<p>
这个表演缺了一个关键的东西，显得不大完整：没有观众的欢呼。结束的时候每次都感觉少了东西。有的人可能喜欢“干净”的表演，但果然没有观众的欢呼互动就没有感觉啊。
</p>

最近听了不少爵士曲子，之后还有几首想要分享。

Lady cab driver, can you take me for a ride? <br />
Don't know where I'm goin' 'cause I don't know where I've been <br />
So just put your foot on the gas, let's drive <br />
Lady, don't ask questions <br />
Promise I'll tell you no lies <br />
Trouble winds are blowin', I'm growin' cold <br />
Get me outta here, I feel I'm gonna die <br />

Lately trouble winds are blowin' hard, and I don't know if I can last <br />

Lady, I'm so lonely <br />
I know that's not the way to be <br />
Don't want isolation, but the air it makes me cold <br />
Drive it, baby, drive it, drive this demon out of me <br />
Take me to your mansion <br />
Honey, let's go everywhere <br />
Help me girl I'm drownin', mass confusion in my head <br />
Will you accept my tears to pay the fare? <br />
 <br />
Lady cab driver, roll up your window fast <br />
Lately trouble winds are blowin' hard, and I don't know if I can last oh, oh <br />
 <br />
Lady cab driver, can you take me for a ride? <br />
 <br />
Lady cab driver, roll up your window fast <br />
Lately trouble winds are blowin' hard, and I don't know if I can last <br />
 <br />
This is for the cab you have to drive for no money at all <br />
This is for why I wasn't born like my brother, handsome and tall <br />
This is for politicians who are bored and believe in war <br />
This, yeah, that's for me, that's who that one's for <br />
This is for discrimination and egotists who think supreme <br />
And this is for whoever taught you how to kiss in designer jeans <br />
That one's for, that one's for, for you have to live <br />
This one's for the rich, not all of 'em, just the greedy, <br />
The ones that don't know how to give <br />
This one's for Yosemite Sam and the tourists at Disneyland <br />
And this one oh yeah, that's the one <br />
That's for that's for the, the creator of man <br />
This is for the sun, the moon, the stars, the tourists at Disneyland <br />
This is for the ocean, the sea, the shore <br />
This is for and that's for you, and that's who that one's for <br />
This is for the women, so beautifully complex <br />
This one's for love without sex <br />
This is for the wind that blows no matter how fast or slow <br />
Not knowing where I'm going <br />
This galaxy's better than not having a place to go <br />
And now I know (I know) <br />
 <br />
Lady cab driver <br />
Lady cab driver <br />
Lady cab driver <br />
Lady cab driver <br />
Lady cab driver <br />
Lady cab driver <br />
Lady cab driver <br />

<b>John Lennon - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O4J4DH4tyo">Jealous Guy</a> - Imagine - 1968</b>

本来只知道Imagine，结果发现整张专辑都很棒。

<p>
I was dreaming of the past <br />
And my heart was beating fast <br />
I began to lose control <br />
I began to lose control <br />
I didn't mean to hurt you <br />
I'm sorry that I made you cry <br />
Oh my I didn't want to hurt you <br />
I'm just a jealous guy <br />
 <br />
I was feeling insecure <br />
You might not love me anymore <br />
I was shivering inside <br />
I was shivering inside <br />
Oh I didn't mean to hurt you <br />
I'm sorry that I made you cry <br />
Oh my I didn't want to hurt you <br />
I'm just a jealous guy <br />
 <br />
I didn't mean to hurt you <br />
I'm sorry that I made you cry <br />
Oh my I didn't want to hurt you <br />
I'm just a jealous guy <br />
 <br />
I was trying to catch your eyes <br />
Thought that you was trying to hide <br />
I was swallowing my pain <br />
I was swallowing my pain <br />
I didn't mean to hurt you <br />
I'm sorry that I made you cry <br />
Oh no I didn't want to hurt you <br />
I'm just a jealous guy <br />
Watch out baby I'm just a jealous guy <br />
Look out baby I'm just a jealous guy <br />

<hr/><div class="lyrics">
<p>
Boards on the window, mail by the door <br />
What would anybody leave so quickly for? <br />
Ophelia - Where have you gone? <br />
 <br />
The old neighborhood just ain't the same <br />
Nobody knows just what became of <br />
Ophelia - tell me, what went wrong? <br />
 <br />
Was it somethin' that somebody said? <br />
Mama, I know we broke the rules <br />
Was somebody up against the law? <br />
Honey, you know I'd die for you <br />
 <br />
Ashes of laughter, the coast is clear <br />
Why do the best things always disappear <br />
Like Ophelia - please darken my door <br />
 <br />
Was it somethin' that somebody said? <br />
Honey, you know we broke the rules <br />
Was somebody up against the law? <br />
Honey, you know I'd die for you <br />

They got your number, scared and runnin' <br />
But I'm still waitin' for the second comin' <br />
Of Ophelia - come back home <br />

</p>

<p>
买了张朋克专辑，结果最喜欢的歌是里面最不朋克的。我发现这种一唱一和的曲调欢快的歌大多能打在我的好球区里。果然这种充满乡土气息（？）的音乐最受广大人民群众（我）的喜爱啊。

晚上的时候，听着这首曲子，看着龙伴随着点点星光从水中 不急不徐的飞出来。我真的感到宁静和祥和，并且发自内心的对这个生物感到崇敬。如果真的有龙的话，一定是这样的吧。我止不住想像千百年前的祖先第一次看到如此强大和美好的存在，把它作为部落的图腾的场景。

<b>Kaleo - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXsK_u4ixI">I Can't Go on Without You</a></b>
</p>

<p>
这首歌是1948年Bull Moose Jackson的单曲，链接里的是经由Kaleo改编后的现场演出。相对于他们专辑里的版本，我更喜欢这首。这首更加过渡更平滑自然，专辑里的版本感觉稍微有点快。
</p>

<p>
Kaleo是一支来自冰岛，有蓝调背景的摇滚乐队。他们有一些超级酷的现场演出：在浮冰，火山口这些地方！我比较好奇的是他们的手指不会冻僵么……在浮冰上演出的时候。
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUY8XtieKLQ">Bull Moose Jackson的版本</a>也很有意思。

<p>
<b>Queen - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kijpcUv-b8M">Somebody To Love</a> - A Day At The Races - 1976</b>
</p>

<p>
A later <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op07UzSCu4c">LIVE</a> performance.
</p>

<p>
皇后乐队的音乐总能给人一种归属感，让人情不自禁的加入进去。他们大部分最受欢迎的歌都是这样。我想这也是Freddie Mercury无与伦比的舞台掌控力的一个因素。
</p>

<hr/><div class="lyrics">
<p>
Can anybody find me somebody to love? <br />
 <br />
Ooh, each morning I get up I die a little <br />
Can barely stand on my feet <br />
(Take a look at yourself) Take a look in the mirror and cry (and cry) <br />
Lord, what you're doing to me (yeah yeah) <br />
I have spent all my years in believing you <br />
But I just can't get no relief, Lord! <br />
Somebody (somebody) ooh somebody (somebody) <br />
Can anybody find me somebody to love? <br />
 <br />
I work hard (he works hard) every day of my life <br />
I work 'til I ache in my bones <br />
At the end (at the end of the day) <br />
I take home my hard earned pay all on my own <br />
I get down (down) on my knees (knees) <br />
And I start to pray <br />
'Til the tears run down from my eyes <br />
Lord, somebody (somebody), ooh somebody <br />
(Please) can anybody find me somebody to love? <br />
 <br />
Everyday (everyday) I try and I try and I try <br />
But everybody wants to put me down <br />
They say I'm going crazy <br />
They say I got a lot of water in my brain <br />
Ah, got no common sense <br />
I got nobody left to believe in <br />
Yeah yeah yeah yeah <br />
 <br />
Oh, Lord <br />
Ooh somebody, ooh somebody <br />
Can anybody find me somebody to love? <br />
(Can anybody find me someone to love) <br />
 <br />
Got no feel, I got no rhythm <br />
I just keep losing my beat (you just keep losing and losing) <br />
I'm OK, I'm alright (he's alright, he's alright) <br />
I ain't gonna face no defeat (yeah yeah) <br />
I just gotta get out of this prison cell <br />
One day (someday) I'm gonna be free, Lord! <br />
 <br />
Find me somebody to love <br />
Find me somebody to love <br />
Find me somebody to love <br />
Find me somebody to love <br />
Find me somebody to love <br />
Find me somebody to love <br />
Find me somebody to love <br />
Find me somebody to love love love <br />
Find me somebody to love <br />
Find me somebody to love <br />
Somebody somebody somebody somebody <br />
Somebody find me <br />
Somebody find me somebody to love <br />
Can anybody find me somebody to love? <br />
(Find me somebody to love) <br />
Ooh <br />
(Find me somebody to love) <br />
Find me somebody, somebody (find me somebody to love) somebody, somebody to love <br />
Find me, find me, find me, find me, find me <br />
Ooh, somebody to love (Find me somebody to love) <br />
Ooh (find me somebody to love) <br />
Find me, find me, find me somebody to love (find me somebody to love) <br />
Anybody, anywhere, anybody find me somebody to love love love! <br />
Somebody find me, find me love <br />

<p>
我第一次听到这首歌是在老滚4的预告片里。
</p>

<hr/><div class="lyrics">
<p>
Oh well, I'm the type of guy who will never settle down <br />
Where pretty girls are, well you know that I'm around <br />
I kiss 'em and I love 'em cause to me they're all the same <br />
I hug 'em and I squeeze 'em they don't even know my name <br />
 <br />
They call me the wanderer <br />
Yeah, the wanderer <br />
I roam around, around, around <br />
 <br />
Oh well, there's Flo on my left and then there's Mary on my right <br />
And Janie is the girl well that I’ll be with tonight <br />
And when she asks me, which one I love the best? <br />
I tear open my shirt and I show "Rosie" on my chest <br />
 <br />
Cause I'm the wanderer <br />
Yeah, the wanderer <br />
I roam around, around, around <br />
 <br />
Oh well, I roam from town to town <br />
I go through life without a care <br />
And I'm as happy as a clown <br />
I with my two fists of iron but I'm going nowhere <br />
 <br />
Oh yeah, I’m the type of guy that likes to roam around <br />
I’m never in one place, I roam from town to town <br />
And when I find myself a-fallin' for some girl <br />
Yeah, I hop right into that car of mine and drive around the world <br />
 <br />
Yeah I'm the wanderer <br />
Yeah, the wanderer <br />
I roam around, around, around <br />

Oh yeah, I'm the type of guy that likes to roam around <br />

</p>

<p>
挺伤心的一首歌。
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Hard_Rain%2527s_a-Gonna_Fall">Wiki</a>
</p>

<hr/><div class="lyrics">
<p>
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son? <br />
Oh, where have you been, my darling young one? <br />
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains <br />
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways <br />
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests <br />
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans <br />
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard <br />
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard <br />
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall <br />
 <br />
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son? <br />
Oh, what did you see, my darling young one? <br />
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it <br />
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it <br />
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin' <br />
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin' <br />
I saw a white ladder all covered with water <br />
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken <br />
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children <br />
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard <br />
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall <br />
 <br />
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son? <br />
And what did you hear, my darling young one? <br />
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin' <br />
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world <br />
Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin' <br />
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter <br />
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley <br />
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard <br />
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall <br />
 <br />
Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son? <br />
Who did you meet, my darling young one? <br />
I met a young child beside a dead pony <br />
I met a white man who walked a black dog <br />
I met a young woman whose body was burning <br />
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow <br />
I met one man who was wounded in love <br />
I met another man who was wounded with hatred <br />
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard <br />
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall <br />
 <br />
Oh, what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son? <br />
Oh, what'll you do now, my darling young one? <br />
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin' <br />
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest <br />
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty <br />
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters <br />
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison <br />
Where the executioner's face is always well-hidden <br />
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten <br />
Where black is the color, where none is the number <br />
And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it <br />
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it <br />
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin' <br />
But I'll know my song well before I start singin' <br />
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard <br />
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall <br />

<b>Janis Joplin - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfGSd-tikH4">Cry Baby</a> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_(album)">Pearl</a> - 1971</b>
</p>

<p>
原作Bert Berns。这首歌是Janis Joplin的翻唱，被收录在《Pearl》中。说到Bert Berns，推荐一部介绍他的纪录片：《Bang: The Bert Berns Story》。
</p>

<p>
听完Janis的歌会有疲惫感，好像你也像她一样用灵魂燃烧了五分钟。
</p>

<hr/><div class="lyrics">
<p>
Cry baby, cry baby, cry baby <br />
Honey, welcome back home <br />
 <br />
I know she told you <br />
Honey, I know she told you that she loved you <br />
Much more than I did <br />
But all I know is that she left you <br />
And you swear that you just don't know why <br />
But you know, honey I'll always <br />
I'll always be around <br />
If you ever want me <br />
Come on and cry, cry baby <br />
Cry baby, cry baby <br />
Oh honey, welcome back home <br />
 <br />
Don't you know <br />
Honey, ain't nobody ever gonna love you <br />
The way I try to do?  <br />
Who'll take all your pain <br />
Honey, your heartache, too?  <br />
And if you need me, you know <br />
That I'll always be around <br />
If you ever want me <br />
Come on and cry, cry baby <br />
Cry baby, cry baby <br />
Oh daddy, like you always saying to do <br />
 <br />
And when you're walkin' around the world, babe <br />
You said you'd try to look for the end of the road <br />
You might find out later that the road'll end in Detroit <br />
Honey, the road'll even end in Kathmandu <br />
You can go all around the world <br />
Trying to find something to do with your life, baby <br />
When you only gotta do one thing well <br />
You only gotta do one thing well to make it in this world, babe <br />
You got a woman waiting for you there <br />
All you ever gotta do is be a good man one time to one woman <br />
And that'll be the end of the road, babe <br />
I know you got more tears to share, babe <br />
So come on, come on, come on, come on, come on <br />
And cry, cry baby <br />
Cry baby, cry <br />
 <br />
And if you ever feel a little lonely, dear <br />
I want you to come on, come on to your mama now <br />
And if you ever want a little love of a woman <br />
Come on and baby, baby, baby, babe, babe, baby now <br />
Cry baby yeah <br />

<b>The Rolling Stones - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PXOHpBneEU">Moonlight Mile</a> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_Fingers">Sticky Fingers</a> - 1971</b>
</p>

<p>
我一直觉得这首歌有浓重的中国风格，滚石也提到这首歌受东亚风格影响，不过他（Mick Jagger）觉得是印度音乐影响。不管他怎么想，对我来说这首歌字里行间全是中国曲调。尤其是“just about a moonlight mile”那段。音乐里听来的这种感觉模模糊糊，描述不出来，只能大概感觉到元宵节万家灯火的那种和美的温馨。并不喧闹，是从远处高空看到星星点点的火光的安静的温馨。
</p>

<hr/><div class="lyrics">
<p>
When the wind blows and the rain feels cold  <br />
With a head full of snow, with a head full of snow  <br />
In the window, there's a face you know  <br />
Don't the night pass slow? Don't the nights pass slow?  <br />
 <br />
The sound of strangers sending nothing to my mind  <br />
Just another mad, mad day on the road  <br />
I am just living to be lying by your side  <br />
But I'm just about a moonlight mile on down the road  <br />
 <br />
Made a rag pile of my shiny clothes  <br />
Going to warm my bones, going to warm my bones  <br />
I've got silence on my radio  <br />
Let the air waves flow, let the air waves flow <br />
  <br />
For I am sleeping under strange, strange skies  <br />
Just another mad, mad day on the road  <br />
My dreams is fading down the railway line  <br />
I'm just about a moonlight mile on down the road <br />
  <br />
Yeah, yeah  <br />
 <br />
I'm hiding, sister, and I'm dreaming  <br />
I'm riding down your moonlight mile  <br />
I'm hiding, baby, but I'm dreaming  <br />
I'm riding down your moonlight mile <br />
I'm riding down your moonlight mile <br />
  <br />
Let it go now <br />
Come on up, baby  <br />
Yeah, let it go now <br />
Yeah  <br />
Flow now, baby <br />
Yeah, come on now, yeah  <br />
 <br />
Hey  <br />
 <br />
Yeah I'm coming home  <br />
Cause I'm just about a moonlight mile on down the road <br />
On down the road, on down the road  <br />
Yeah, yeah baby <br />

There's something happening here <br />
What it is ain't exactly clear <br />
There's a man with a gun over there <br />
Telling me I got to beware <br />

I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound <br />
Everybody look what's going down <br />
 <br />
There's battle lines being drawn <br />
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong <br />
Young people speaking their minds <br />
Getting so much resistance from behind <br />
 <br />
It's time we stop, hey, what's that sound <br />
Everybody look what's going down <br />
 <br />
What a field-day for the heat <br />
A thousand people in the street <br />
Singing songs and carrying signs <br />
Mostly say, hooray for our side <br />
 <br />
It's s time we stop, hey, what's that sound <br />
Everybody look what's going down <br />
 <br />
Paranoia strikes deep <br />
Into your life it will creep <br />
It starts when you're always afraid <br />
You step out of line, the man come and take you away <br />
 <br />
We better stop, hey, what's that sound <br />
Everybody look what's going down <br />
Stop, hey, what's that sound <br />
Everybody look what's going down <br />
Stop, now, what's that sound <br />
Everybody look what's going down <br />
Stop, children, what's that sound <br />

We get it almost every night <br />
When that moon is big and bright <br />
It's a supernatural delight <br />
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight <br />
 <br />
Everybody here is out of sight <br />
They don't bark, and they don't bite <br />
They keep things loose, they keep 'em tight <br />
Everybody was dancin' in the moonlight <br />
 <br />
Dancin' in the moonlight <br />
Everybody's feelin' warm and bright <br />
It's such a fine and natural sight <br />
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight <br />
 <br />
We like our fun and we never fight <br />
You can't dance and stay uptight <br />
It's a supernatural delight <br />
Everybody was dancin' in the moonlight <br />
 <br />
Dancin' in the moonlight <br />
Everybody's feelin' warm and bright <br />
It's such a fine and natural sight <br />
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight <br />

We get it almost every night <br />
When that moon is big and bright <br />
It's a supernatural delight <br />
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight <br />

Dancin' in the moonlight <br />
Everybody's feelin' warm and bright <br />

<p>
Don't let me down, don't let me down <br />
Don't let me down, don't let me down <br />
 <br />
Nobody ever loved me like she does <br />
Oh, she does, yeah, she does <br />
And if somebody loved me like she do me <br />
Oh, she do me, yes, she does <br />
 <br />
Don't let me down, don't let me down <br />
Don't let me down, don't let me down <br />

I'm in love for the first time <br />
Don't you know it's gonna last <br />
It's a love that lasts forever <br />
It's a love that had no past <br />
 <br />
Don't let me down, don't let me down <br />
Don't let me down, don't let me down <br />
 <br />
And from the first time that she really done me <br />
Oh, she done me, she done me good <br />
I guess nobody ever really done me <br />
Oh, she done me, she done me good <br />

Don't let me down, hey, don't let me down <br />
Heee! Don't let me down <br />

"You Can't Always Get What You Want" was recorded on 16 and 17 November 1968 at Olympic Sound Studios in London. It features the London Bach Choir opening the song (the choir opening is only on the album version), highlighting throughout, and bringing it to its conclusion.

I saw her today at the reception <br />
A glass of wine in her hand <br />
I knew she would meet her connection <br />
At her feet was her footloose man <br />
 <br />
No, you can't always get what you want <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
But if you try sometime you find <br />
You get what you need <br />

You can't always get what you want <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
But if you try sometimes you might find <br />
You get what you need <br />
 <br />
But I went down to the demonstration <br />
To get your fair share of abuse <br />
Singing, "We're gonna vent our frustration <br />
If we don't we're gonna blow a fifty-amp fuse" <br />
 <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
But if you try sometimes well you just might find <br />
You get what you need <br />
 <br />
I went down to the Chelsea drugstore <br />
To get your prescription filled <br />
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy <br />
And man, did he look pretty ill <br />
We decided that we would have a soda <br />
My favorite flavor, cherry red <br />
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy <br />
Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was "dead" <br />
I said to him <br />
 <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
But if you try sometimes you just might find <br />
You get what you need <br />
 <br />
You get what you need, yeah, oh baby <br />
 <br />
I saw her today at the reception <br />
In her glass was a bleeding man <br />
She was practiced at the art of deception <br />
Well I could tell by her blood-stained hands <br />
 <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
You can't always get what you want <br />
But if you try sometimes you just might find <br />

<b>Lynyrd Skynyrd - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSvKkMs2ieo">The Ballad of Curtis Loew</a> - 1974</b>
</p>

<hr/><div class="lyrics">
<p>
Well, I used to wake the mornin' <br />
Before the rooster crowed <br />
Searchin' for soda bottles <br />
To get myself some dough <br />
Brought 'em down to the corner <br />
Down to the country store <br />
Cash 'em in, and give my money <br />
To a man named Curtis Loew <br />
 <br />
Old Curt was a black man <br />
With white curly hair <br />
When he had a fifth of wine <br />
He did not have a care <br />
He used to own an old Dobro <br />
Used to play it 'cross his knee <br />
I'd give old Curt my money <br />
He'd play all day for me <br />
 <br />
Play me a song <br />
Curtis Loew, Curtis Loew <br />
Well, I got your drinkin' money <br />
Tune up your Dobro <br />
People said he was useless <br />
Them people all were fools <br />
'Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker <br />
To ever play the blues <br />
 <br />
He looked to be sixty <br />
And maybe I was ten <br />
Mama used to whoop me <br />
But I'd go see him again <br />
I'd clap my hands, stomp my feet <br />
Try to stay in time <br />
He'd play me a song or two <br />
Then take another drink of wine <br />
 <br />
Play me a song <br />
Curtis Loew, Curtis Loew <br />
Well, I got your drinkin' money <br />
Tune up your Dobro <br />
People said he was useless <br />
Them people all were fools <br />
'Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker <br />
To ever play the blues <br />
 <br />
Yes, sir <br />
 <br />
On the day old Curtis died <br />
Nobody came to pray <br />
Ol' preacher said some words <br />
And they chunked him in the clay <br />
Well, he lived a lifetime <br />
Playin' the black man's blues <br />
And on the day he lost his life <br />
That's all he had to lose <br />
 <br />
Play me a song <br />
Curtis Loew, hey Curtis Loew <br />
I wish that you was here so <br />
Everyone would know <br />
People said he was useless <br />
Them people all were fools <br />
'Cause Curtis you're the finest picker <br />
To ever play the blues <br />

<p>
[Verse 1] <br />
It was twenty years ago today <br />
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play <br />
They've been going in and out of style <br />
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile <br />
So may I introduce to you <br />
The act you've known for all these years <br />
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band <br />
 <br />
[Bridge] <br />
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band <br />
We hope you will enjoy the show <br />
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band <br />
Sit back and let the evening go <br />
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely <br />
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band <br />
It's wonderful to be here <br />
It's certainly a thrill <br />
You're such a lovely audience <br />
We'd like to take you home with us <br />
We'd love to take you home <br />
 <br />
[Verse 2] <br />
I don't really want to stop the show <br />
But I thought you might like to know <br />
That the singer's going to sing a song <br />
And he wants you all to sing along <br />
So let me introduce to you <br />
The one and only Billy Shears <br />

Billy Shears! <br />
 <br />
[Verse 1: Ringo Starr] <br />
What would you think if I sang out of tune? <br />
Would you stand up and walk out on me? <br />
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song <br />
And I'll try not to sing out of key <br />
 <br />
[Chorus: Ringo Starr] <br />
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends <br />
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends <br />
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends <br />
 <br />
[Verse 2: Ringo Starr &amp; The Beatles] <br />
What do I do when my love is away? <br />
Does it worry you to be alone? <br />
How do I feel by the end of the day? <br />
Are you sad because you're on your own? <br />
 <br />
[Chorus: Ringo Starr] <br />
No, I get by with a little help from my friends <br />
Mm, get high with a little help from my friends <br />
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends <br />
 <br />
[Bridge: Ringo Starr &amp; The Beatles] <br />
Do you need anybody? <br />
I need somebody to love <br />
Could it be anybody? <br />
I want somebody to love <br />
 <br />
 <br />
[Verse 3: Ringo Starr &amp; The Beatles] <br />
Would you believe in a love at first sight? <br />
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time <br />
What do you see when you turn out the light? <br />
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine <br />
 <br />
[Chorus: Ringo Starr] <br />
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends <br />
Mm, get high with a little help from my friends <br />
Oh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends <br />

[Bridge: Ringo Starr &amp; The Beatles] <br />
Do you need anybody? <br />
I just need someone to love <br />
Could it be anybody? <br />
I want somebody to love <br />

Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends <br />
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends <br />

If there is one classic way of Mick and I working together, this is it. I had the riff and the chorus line, Mick got stuck into the verses. Just like Satisfaction.

Childhood living is easy to do. <br />
The things you wanted <br />
I bought them for you. <br />
Graceless lady <br />
you know how I am <br />
you know I can't let you <br />
slide through my hands. <br />
 <br />
Wild horses <br />
couldn't drag me away. <br />
Wild, wild horses <br />
couldn't drag me away. <br />
 <br />
I watched you suffer <br />
a dull aching pain. <br />
Now you decided to <br />
show me the same. <br />
But no sweeping exits or offstage lines <br />
could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind. <br />
 <br />
Wild Horses <br />
couldn't drag me away. <br />
Wild, wild horses <br />
couldn't drag me away. <br />
 <br />
I know I've dreamed you a sin and a lie <br />
I have my freedom but I don't have much time <br />
Faith has been broken tears must be cried <br />
Let's do some living after we die <br />

Wild Horses <br />
couldn't drag me away. <br />
Wild, wild horses <br />

Went to Pére Lachaise in Paris to see Jim Morrison's grave last September, all of a sudden this Australian dude rocks up in full leather gear, blaring this song as loud as he possibly could, barging through the small crowd. Everybody, I mean EVERYBODY is staring at him, and he just shouts "What? It's appropriate!" I never laughed so hard in a cemetery. I still think of that guy sometimes.﻿

The thoughts behind this song - it was a lot of anger. So it was the Vietnam War going on&#x2026; Now I was drafted and they're making me fight, and no one has actually defined why. So this was all boiling inside of me and I sat down on the edge of my bed and out came "It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no senator's son!" You know, it took about 20 minutes to write the song.

<p>
Some folks are born made to wave the flag <br />
Ooh, they're red, white and blue <br />
And when the band plays "Hail to the chief" <br />
Ooh, they point the cannon at you, Lord <br />
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no senator's son, son <br />
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, no <br />
 <br />
Some folks are born silver spoon in hand <br />
Lord, don't they help themselves, oh <br />
But when the taxman comes to the door <br />
Lord, the house looks like a rummage sale, yes <br />
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no millionaire's son, no <br />
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, no <br />
 <br />
Some folks inherit star spangled eyes <br />
Ooh, they send you down to war, Lord <br />
And when you ask them, "How much should we give?" <br />
Ooh, they only answer "More! More! More!" y'all <br />
 <br />
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no military son, son <br />
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, one <br />
 <br />
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, no no no <br />
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate son, no no no <br />

引用维基百科：
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
这是一首传统民谣，也叫日晟蓝调。讲述了一个人在新奥尔良的悲惨生活，很多版本中还告诫兄弟姐妹不要不要重蹈覆辙。
</p>

<p>
An interview with Eric Burdon revealed that he first heard the song in a club in Newcastle, England, where it was sung by the Northumbrian folk singer Johnny Handle. The Animals were on tour with Chuck Berry and chose it because they wanted something distinctive to sing.

<p>
There is a house down in New Orleans <br />
They call the Rising Sun. <br />
And it's been the ruin of many a-poor boy <br />
And me&#x2013;oh, God&#x2013;I'm one <br />
 <br />
My mother was a tailor <br />
She sewed these new blue jeans <br />
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord <br />
Down in New Orleans <br />
 <br />
Now the only thing a gambler needs <br />
Is a suitcase and a trunk <br />
And the only time he's satisfied <br />
Is when he's on a drunk <br />
 <br />
He fills his glasses up to the brim <br />
And he'll pass the cards around <br />
And the only pleasure he gets out of life <br />
Is ramblin' from town to town <br />
 <br />
Oh, tell my baby sister <br />
Not to do what I have done! <br />
But shun that house in New Orleans <br />
They call the Rising Sun <br />
 <br />
Well it's one foot on the platform <br />
The other foot on the train! <br />
I'm goin' back to New Orleans <br />
To wear that ball and chain <br />
 <br />
 <br />
I'm a goin' back to New Orleans <br />
My race is almost run! <br />
I'm goin' back to end my life <br />
Down in the Rising Sun <br />
 <br />
There is a house in New Orleans <br />
They call the Rising Sun <br />
It's been the ruin of many a-poor boy <br />
And me&#x2013;oh, God&#x2013;I'm one <br />

<p>
Didn't I make you feel <br />
Like you were the only man, yeah <br />
Didn't I give you everything that a woman possibly can? <br />
But with all the love I give ya <br />
It's never enough <br />
But I'm gonna show you, baby, that a woman can be tough <br />
So come on, come on, come on, come on <br />
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby! <br />
Break it! <br />
Break another little bit of my heart now, honey <br />
Have a! <br />
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby <br />
You know you got it if it makes you feel good <br />
You're out on the street (looking good) <br />
And you know deep down in your heart that it ain't right <br />
And ah, you never, never hear me when I cry at night <br />
And oh oh I, I tell myself that I can't stand the pain <br />
But when you hold me in your arms, I say it again <br />
So come on, come on, come on, come on <br />
And take it! <br />
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby! <br />
Hey, break it! <br />
Break another little bit of my heart now, baby <br />
You can have a! <br />
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby <br />
You know you got it if it makes you feel good <br />
Hey, hey <br />
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby! <br />
Oh, break it! <br />
Break another little bit of my heart now, honey <br />
Hey, have a! <br />
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby <br />

Angie, Angie <br />
When will those clouds all disappear? <br />
Angie, Angie <br />
Where will it lead us from here? <br />
With no loving in our soul <br />
And no money in our coats <br />
You can't say we're satisfied <br />
But Angie, Angie <br />
You can't say we never tried <br />
Angie, you're beautiful <br />
But ain't it time we said goodbye? <br />
Angie, I still love you <br />
Remember all those nights we cried? <br />
All the dreams we held so close <br />
Seemed to all go up in smoke <br />
Let me whisper in your ear <br />
Angie, Angie <br />
Where will it lead us from here? <br />
 <br />
Oh, Angie, don't you weep <br />
All your kisses still taste sweet <br />
I hate that sadness in your eyes <br />
Angie, Angie <br />
Ain't it time we said goodbye? <br />
Angie, Angie <br />
Ain't it time we said goodbye? <br />
With no loving in our souls <br />
And no money in our coats <br />
You can't say were satisfied <br />
But Angie, I still love you, Baby <br />
Everywhere I look I see your eyes <br />
There ain't a woman that comes close to you <br />
Come on Baby, dry your eyes <br />
But Angie, Angie <br />
Ain't it good to be alive? <br />
Angie, Angie <br />
They can't say we never tried <br />

<b>Joan Chamorro Presenta &amp; Alba Armengou - <a href="https://youtu.be/kP_z6NFJXBU">I Feel Pretty</a></b>
</p>

<p>
这首歌歌词很可爱。编曲也很有新意，我听了听之前的版本，节奏都慢很多。相比之下这个编排我更喜欢。跟之前那个“crazy hue”一样，这首歌里也有个词我感觉主唱发得很有意思www，只不过忘了是哪个了。以后有时间再补吧。

I feel pretty <br />
Oh, so pretty <br />
I feel pretty and witty and bright! <br />
And I pity <br />
Any girl who isn't me tonight <br />
 <br />
I feel charming <br />
Oh, so charming <br />
It's alarming how charming I feel! <br />
And so pretty <br />
That I hardly can believe I'm real <br />
 <br />
See the pretty girl in that mirror there <br />
Who can that attractive girl be? <br />
Such a pretty face <br />
Such a pretty dress <br />
Such a pretty smile <br />
Such a pretty me! <br />
 <br />
I feel stunning <br />
And entrancing <br />
Feel like running and dancing for joy <br />
For I'm loved <br />
By a pretty wonderful boy! <br />
