<p>
[Verse 1] <br />
It was twenty years ago today <br />
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play <br />
They've been going in and out of style <br />
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile <br />
So may I introduce to you <br />
The act you've known for all these years <br />
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band <br />
 <br />
[Bridge] <br />
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band <br />
We hope you will enjoy the show <br />
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band <br />
Sit back and let the evening go <br />
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely <br />
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band <br />
It's wonderful to be here <br />
It's certainly a thrill <br />
You're such a lovely audience <br />
We'd like to take you home with us <br />
We'd love to take you home <br />
 <br />
[Verse 2] <br />
I don't really want to stop the show <br />
But I thought you might like to know <br />
That the singer's going to sing a song <br />
And he wants you all to sing along <br />
So let me introduce to you <br />
The one and only Billy Shears <br />
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band <br />
</p>

<b>With A Little Help From My Friends</b>
</p>

<p>
[Segue: The Beatles] <br />
Billy Shears! <br />
 <br />
[Verse 1: Ringo Starr] <br />
What would you think if I sang out of tune? <br />
Would you stand up and walk out on me? <br />
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song <br />
And I'll try not to sing out of key <br />
 <br />
[Chorus: Ringo Starr] <br />
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends <br />
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends <br />
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends <br />
 <br />
[Verse 2: Ringo Starr &amp; The Beatles] <br />
What do I do when my love is away? <br />
Does it worry you to be alone? <br />
How do I feel by the end of the day? <br />
Are you sad because you're on your own? <br />
 <br />
[Chorus: Ringo Starr] <br />
No, I get by with a little help from my friends <br />
Mm, get high with a little help from my friends <br />
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends <br />
 <br />
[Bridge: Ringo Starr &amp; The Beatles] <br />
Do you need anybody? <br />
I need somebody to love <br />
Could it be anybody? <br />
I want somebody to love <br />
 <br />
 <br />
[Verse 3: Ringo Starr &amp; The Beatles] <br />
Would you believe in a love at first sight? <br />
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time <br />
What do you see when you turn out the light? <br />
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine <br />
 <br />
[Chorus: Ringo Starr] <br />
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends <br />
Mm, get high with a little help from my friends <br />
Oh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends <br />
 <br />
[Bridge: Ringo Starr &amp; The Beatles] <br />
Do you need anybody? <br />
I just need someone to love <br />
Could it be anybody? <br />
I want somebody to love <br />
 <br />
[Outro: Ringo Starr] <br />
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends <br />
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends <br />
Oh, I get high with a little help from my friends <br />
Yes, I get by with a little help from my friends <br />
With a little help from my friends <br />
