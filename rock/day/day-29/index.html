Taxi, taxi <br />
 <br />
Lady cab driver, can you take me for a ride? <br />
Don't know where I'm goin' 'cause I don't know where I've been <br />
So just put your foot on the gas, let's drive <br />
Lady, don't ask questions <br />
Promise I'll tell you no lies <br />
Trouble winds are blowin', I'm growin' cold <br />
Get me outta here, I feel I'm gonna die <br />
 <br />
Lady cab driver, roll up your window fast <br />
Lately trouble winds are blowin' hard, and I don't know if I can last <br />
 <br />
Lady, I'm so lonely <br />
I know that's not the way to be <br />
Don't want isolation, but the air it makes me cold <br />
Drive it, baby, drive it, drive this demon out of me <br />
Take me to your mansion <br />
Honey, let's go everywhere <br />
Help me girl I'm drownin', mass confusion in my head <br />
Will you accept my tears to pay the fare? <br />
 <br />
Lady cab driver, roll up your window fast <br />
Lately trouble winds are blowin' hard, and I don't know if I can last oh, oh <br />
 <br />
Lady cab driver, can you take me for a ride? <br />
 <br />
Lady cab driver, roll up your window fast <br />
Lately trouble winds are blowin' hard, and I don't know if I can last <br />
 <br />
This is for the cab you have to drive for no money at all <br />
This is for why I wasn't born like my brother, handsome and tall <br />
This is for politicians who are bored and believe in war <br />
This, yeah, that's for me, that's who that one's for <br />
This is for discrimination and egotists who think supreme <br />
And this is for whoever taught you how to kiss in designer jeans <br />
That one's for, that one's for, for you have to live <br />
This one's for the rich, not all of 'em, just the greedy, <br />
The ones that don't know how to give <br />
This one's for Yosemite Sam and the tourists at Disneyland <br />
And this one oh yeah, that's the one <br />
That's for that's for the, the creator of man <br />
This is for the sun, the moon, the stars, the tourists at Disneyland <br />
This is for the ocean, the sea, the shore <br />
This is for and that's for you, and that's who that one's for <br />
This is for the women, so beautifully complex <br />
This one's for love without sex <br />
This is for the wind that blows no matter how fast or slow <br />
Not knowing where I'm going <br />
This galaxy's better than not having a place to go <br />
And now I know (I know) <br />
 <br />
Lady cab driver <br />
Lady cab driver <br />
Lady cab driver <br />
Lady cab driver <br />
Lady cab driver <br />
Lady cab driver <br />
Lady cab driver <br />
