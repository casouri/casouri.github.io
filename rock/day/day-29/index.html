    <p>有点色情www 但很有趣。</p><p><em>1999</em> 里还有另一首我很喜欢的歌，<a href="https://youtu.be/OUZyb7YeEYA">Little Red Corvette</a>，很有感觉。这首歌有两种版本，一种是 <em>1999</em> 里的完整版，还有个删减的舞曲版，那首删掉了最精彩的部份……</p><h2>Lady Cab Driver</h2><div><hr/><div class="lyrics"><p>Taxi, taxi</p><p>Lady cab driver, can you take me for a ride?<br/>Don't know where I'm goin' 'cause I don't know where I've been<br/>So just put your foot on the gas, let's drive<br/>Lady, don't ask questions<br/>Promise I'll tell you no lies<br/>Trouble winds are blowin', I'm growin' cold<br/>Get me outta here, I feel I'm gonna die</p><p>Lady cab driver, roll up your window fast<br/>Lately trouble winds are blowin' hard, and I don't know if I can last</p><p>Lady, I'm so lonely<br/>I know that's not the way to be<br/>Don't want isolation, but the air it makes me cold<br/>Drive it, baby, drive it, drive this demon out of me<br/>Take me to your mansion<br/>Honey, let's go everywhere<br/>Help me girl I'm drownin', mass confusion in my head<br/>Will you accept my tears to pay the fare?</p><p>Lady cab driver, roll up your window fast<br/>Lately trouble winds are blowin' hard, and I don't know if I can last oh, oh</p><p>Lady cab driver, can you take me for a ride?</p><p>Lady cab driver, roll up your window fast<br/>Lately trouble winds are blowin' hard, and I don't know if I can last</p><p>This is for the cab you have to drive for no money at all<br/>This is for why I wasn't born like my brother, handsome and tall<br/>This is for politicians who are bored and believe in war<br/>This, yeah, that's for me, that's who that one's for<br/>This is for discrimination and egotists who think supreme<br/>And this is for whoever taught you how to kiss in designer jeans<br/>That one's for, that one's for, for you have to live<br/>This one's for the rich, not all of 'em, just the greedy,<br/>The ones that don't know how to give<br/>This one's for Yosemite Sam and the tourists at Disneyland<br/>And this one oh yeah, that's the one<br/>That's for that's for the, the creator of man<br/>This is for the sun, the moon, the stars, the tourists at Disneyland<br/>This is for the ocean, the sea, the shore<br/>This is for and that's for you, and that's who that one's for<br/>This is for the women, so beautifully complex<br/>This one's for love without sex<br/>This is for the wind that blows no matter how fast or slow<br/>Not knowing where I'm going<br/>This galaxy's better than not having a place to go<br/>And now I know (I know)</p><p>Lady cab driver<br/>Lady cab driver<br/>Lady cab driver<br/>Lady cab driver<br/>Lady cab driver<br/>Lady cab driver<br/>Lady cab driver</p></div></div><h2>Little Red Corvette</h2><div><hr/><div class="lyrics"><p>I guess I should've known by the way<br/>You parked your car sideways that it wouldn't last<br/>See, you're the kinda person that believes in makin' out once<br/>Love 'em and leave 'em fast</p><p>I guess I must be dumb<br/>'Cause you had a pocket full of horses<br/>Trojan and some of them used<br/>But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right<br/>And you say, "What have I got to lose?"</p><p>And honey, I say Little Red Corvette<br/>Baby, you're much too fast<br/>(Oh)<br/>Little Red Corvette<br/>You need a love that's gonna last</p><p>I guess I should've closed my eyes<br/>When you drove me to the place where your horses run free<br/>'Cause I felt a little ill when I saw all the pictures<br/>Of the jockeys that were there before me</p><p>Believe it or not, I started to worry<br/>I wondered if I had enough class<br/>But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right<br/>And you say, "Baby, have you got enough gas?", Oh yeah</p><p>Little Red Corvette<br/>Baby, you're much too fast<br/>(Yes, you are)<br/>Little Red Corvette<br/>You need to find a love that's gonna last<br/>(Oh, oh)</p><p>A body like yours oughta be in jail<br/>'Cause it's on the verge of bein' obscene<br/>Move over, baby, gimme the keys<br/>I'm gonna try to tame your little red love machine</p><p>Little Red Corvette<br/>Baby, you're much too fast<br/>Little Red Corvette<br/>Need to find a love that's gonna last, hey
