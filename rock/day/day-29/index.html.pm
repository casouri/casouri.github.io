有点色情www 但很有趣。

◊em{1999} 里还有另一首我很喜欢的歌，◊link["https://youtu.be/OUZyb7YeEYA"]{Little Red Corvette}，很有感觉。这首歌有两种版本，一种是 ◊em{1999} 里的完整版，还有个删减的舞曲版，那首删掉了最精彩的部份……

◊lyrics{
Taxi, taxi

Lady cab driver, can you take me for a ride?
Don't know where I'm goin' 'cause I don't know where I've been
So just put your foot on the gas, let's drive
Lady, don't ask questions
Promise I'll tell you no lies
Trouble winds are blowin', I'm growin' cold
Get me outta here, I feel I'm gonna die

Lady cab driver, roll up your window fast
Lately trouble winds are blowin' hard, and I don't know if I can last

Lady, I'm so lonely
I know that's not the way to be
Don't want isolation, but the air it makes me cold
Drive it, baby, drive it, drive this demon out of me
Take me to your mansion
Honey, let's go everywhere
Help me girl I'm drownin', mass confusion in my head
Will you accept my tears to pay the fare?

Lady cab driver, roll up your window fast
Lately trouble winds are blowin' hard, and I don't know if I can last oh, oh

Lady cab driver, can you take me for a ride?

Lady cab driver, roll up your window fast
Lately trouble winds are blowin' hard, and I don't know if I can last

This is for the cab you have to drive for no money at all
This is for why I wasn't born like my brother, handsome and tall
This is for politicians who are bored and believe in war
This, yeah, that's for me, that's who that one's for
This is for discrimination and egotists who think supreme
And this is for whoever taught you how to kiss in designer jeans
That one's for, that one's for, for you have to live
This one's for the rich, not all of 'em, just the greedy,
The ones that don't know how to give
This one's for Yosemite Sam and the tourists at Disneyland
And this one oh yeah, that's the one
That's for that's for the, the creator of man
This is for the sun, the moon, the stars, the tourists at Disneyland
This is for the ocean, the sea, the shore
This is for and that's for you, and that's who that one's for
This is for the women, so beautifully complex
This one's for love without sex
This is for the wind that blows no matter how fast or slow
Not knowing where I'm going
This galaxy's better than not having a place to go
And now I know (I know)

Lady cab driver

◊lyrics{
I guess I should've known by the way
You parked your car sideways that it wouldn't last
See, you're the kinda person that believes in makin' out once
Love 'em and leave 'em fast

I guess I must be dumb
'Cause you had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say, "What have I got to lose?"

And honey, I say Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast
(Oh)
Little Red Corvette
You need a love that's gonna last

I guess I should've closed my eyes
When you drove me to the place where your horses run free
'Cause I felt a little ill when I saw all the pictures
Of the jockeys that were there before me

Believe it or not, I started to worry
I wondered if I had enough class
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say, "Baby, have you got enough gas?", Oh yeah

Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast
(Yes, you are)
Little Red Corvette
You need to find a love that's gonna last
(Oh, oh)

A body like yours oughta be in jail
'Cause it's on the verge of bein' obscene
Move over, baby, gimme the keys
I'm gonna try to tame your little red love machine

Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast
Little Red Corvette
Need to find a love that's gonna last, hey hey

Little Red Corvette
Honey, you got to slow down
(Got to slow down)
Little Red Corvette

'Cause if you don't, you're gonna run your little red corvette
Right in the ground
(Little Red Corvette)
Right down to the ground
(Honey, you got to slow down)

You, you, you got to slow down
(Little Red Corvette)
You're movin' much too fast, too fast
Need to find a love that's gonna last

Girl, you got an ass like I never seen, ow
And the ride
I say the ride is so smooth, you must be a Limousine

Ow, baby, you're much too fast
Little Red Corvette
You need a love, you need a love that's, uh, that's gonna last
(Little Red Corvette)

Babe, you got to slow down
(Y got to slow down)
Little Red Corvette
'Cause if you don't, 'cause if you don't

You're gonna run your body right into the ground
(Right into the ground)
Right into the ground
(Right into the ground)
Right into the ground
(Right into the ground)
