  Two to the one, from the one to the three
  I like good, pussy and I like good tree
  Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
  And I get mo' ass than a toilet seat
  Three to the one, from the one to the three
  I met a bad bitch last night in the D
  Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
  Conversation and Hennessy
  I've been to the motherfuckin' mountain top
  Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
  If I ain't got a weapon I'mma pick up a rock
  And when I bust yo ass I'm gon' continue to rock
  Get your ass off the wall, with your two left feet
  It's real easy just follow the beat
  Don't let that fine girl pass you by
  Look real close cause strobe lights lie
  We about to have a party (turn the music up)
  Let's get it started (go 'head shake your butt)
  I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
  Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
  Some girls they act retarded
  Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
  I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
  I say, every day she be givin' it up

  Now, shake that ass for me
  Shake that ass for me
  Come on girl, shake that ass for me
  Shake that ass for me
  Ohh girl, shake that ass for me
  Shake that ass for me
  Come on girl, shake that ass for me
  Shake that ass for me
  
  Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk, get fucked up
  Hit the strip club, don't forget the ones, get your dick rubbed
  Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
  Pasted, plastered, puke drink, throw up
  Get a new drink, hit the bathroom sink, throw up
  Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
  Still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'
  I was dehydrated, till the beat vibrated
  I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated
  Them hips and licked them lips and that was it
  I had to get Nate Dogg in to sing some shit
  
  Now, shake that ass for me
  Shake that ass for me
  Come on girl, shake that ass for me
  Shake that ass for me
  Ohh girl, shake that ass for me
  Shake that ass for me
  Come on girl, shake that ass for me
  Shake that ass for me
  
  We about to have a party (turn the music up)
  Let's get it started (go 'head shake your butt)
  I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
  Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
  Some girls they act retarded
  Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
  
  I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
  I say, every day she be givin' it up
  There she go
  Shakin' that ass on the flo'
  Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
  The way she's grindin' that pole
  I think I'm losin' control
  God!
  I ain't leaving without you, bitch!
  You're comin' home with me
  And my boy
  And his boy
  And his boy
  And his girl
  Haha, Nate Dogg!
  
  I'm just playing games
  I know that's plastic love
  Dance to the plastic beat
  Another morning comes
  I'm just playing games
  I know that's plastic love
  Dance to the plastic beat
  Another morning comes
  I'm just playing games
  I know that's plastic love
