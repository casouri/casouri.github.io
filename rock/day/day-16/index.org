Cry baby, cry baby, cry baby
Honey, welcome back home

I know she told you
Honey, I know she told you that she loved you
Much more than I did
But all I know is that she left you
And you swear that you just don't know why
But you know, honey I'll always
I'll always be around
If you ever want me
Come on and cry, cry baby
Cry baby, cry baby
Oh honey, welcome back home

Don't you know
Honey, ain't nobody ever gonna love you
The way I try to do? 
Who'll take all your pain
Honey, your heartache, too? 
And if you need me, you know
That I'll always be around
If you ever want me
Come on and cry, cry baby
Cry baby, cry baby
Oh daddy, like you always saying to do

And when you're walkin' around the world, babe
You said you'd try to look for the end of the road
You might find out later that the road'll end in Detroit
Honey, the road'll even end in Kathmandu
You can go all around the world
Trying to find something to do with your life, baby
When you only gotta do one thing well
You only gotta do one thing well to make it in this world, babe
You got a woman waiting for you there
All you ever gotta do is be a good man one time to one woman
And that'll be the end of the road, babe
I know you got more tears to share, babe
So come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
And cry, cry baby
Cry baby, cry

And if you ever feel a little lonely, dear
I want you to come on, come on to your mama now
And if you ever want a little love of a woman
Come on and baby, baby, baby, babe, babe, baby now
Cry baby yeah
