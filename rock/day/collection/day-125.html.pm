我完全是为了这首歌玩的 P3R。在哔哩哔哩上看到这首歌以后惊为天人，太潮了，太舒服了，大脑像是被音乐按摩了一样。进游戏到了晚上的街上，这首歌悄然响起，身上汗毛倒竖。

专辑里的 Full Moon Full Life，Want to Be Close，Deep Breath Deep Breath 也都非常棒，游戏里听到的时候就十分享受，出来单独听也别有风味。

◊lyrics{
Time to shine and I'm down to ride
I'm gonna drive until the break of dawn, wilding out
I'm on a mission, grinding out
Whatever it is I gotta do
Riding out until the day I meet you, I'm riding out
I look up in the sky
Ask a lot of: Why?
But never let it faze me, I'm keeping good vibes
When I'm on the road, watch out for all surprises
What it provides us
Good or bad but nothing unties us

Another wander in the night
Let me paint the view
Color the town with my light
For every moment shared with you
Not out in the day
But never fully gone
Going to be back again
Until the coming of the dawn

(Hey)
For all the days ahead of us, put your hands up
Wave 'em side to side for good luck, uh
(Hey)
For all the nights like this, put your hands up
Love the moment even from dusk, yup
(Hey)
You always got my back, and of course I got your back
Don't you worry 'bout that, now
(Hey)
It's been a good day, good night
It's gonna be a good day, good night

Two hands meet at zenith
Nothing comes between us
Dancin' like ballerinas
Under the moonlight all night long
How these plain and simple scenes get painted so vividly by you
I just wanna stay with you

Around the world I slowly dance
Whenever our eyes meet
You know you leave me in a trance
It means everything to me
Looking down below
The one I seek to find
No matter where you might go
Remember, you'll be on my mind

Always watching over me, somehow you make me feel invincible
Power to my soul, yup
I'm at easy with things that used to bother me
'Cause your existence just lights me up
You always got my back and of course I got your back
Don't you worry 'bout that, now
It's been a good day, good night
It's gonna be a good day, good night

Within the inner heart, I plead
For you to talk to me
I wanna hear all the good and bad
The new stories you have
As I drift across the sky
The hour hand turns high
So, goodnight
Let me sing a lullaby now
I'll be singing, baby
