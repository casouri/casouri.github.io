这种 Indie Hip-Hop R&B Alt Lo-Fi 音乐一般不在我雷达上。但是之前不是听了哔哩哔哩上 PB 的歌嘛（◊link["./day-102.html"]{◊em{Day 102}}），她的那个歌单里有一首是今天主角 Arlo Parks 的翻唱：◊link["https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Ca411P7sB"]{Chill 到可以驱散炎热夏日的歌  Arlo Parks - Paperbacks (Cover)}。我倒没觉得 Paperbacks 有多神，但是 PB 对 Arlo Parks 的介绍极尽推崇，我就去 Spotify 上听了听，结果真的名不虚传www 感觉让人耳目一新。

◊lyrics{
  Why do we make the simplest things so hard?

  I bought you breakfast and you started your rings
  The air was fragrant and thick with our silence
  I held my breath as something deep inside pinched
  I touched the bump on your wrist you were born with

  Watching you trying to push away
  It hurts when you see it coming
  You’re too proud to tell me that you care
  Watching you trying to push away
  It hurts when you see it coming
  Never use your words to show you care

  I think you know it
  Too cool to show it
  Babe, you’re so good
  You’re too good to be true
  I think you know it
  Too cool to show it
  Babe, you’re so good
  You’re too good to be true

  Oh, oh, oh, oh
  Why do we make the simplest things so hard?

  I let my pain out through the way that I sit
  And start to pick at the rips in my Nikes
  You quote Thom Yorke and lean in for a quick kiss
  But still you just won’t admit that you like me

  Watching you lower both your eyes
  It hurts when you know it’s over
  Still too stubborn to show that you care
  Watching you lower both your eyes
  It hurts when you know it’s over
  I feel like you never really cared

  I think you know it
  Too cool to show it
  Babe, you’re so good
  You’re too good to be true
  I think you know it
  Too cool to show it
  Babe, you’re so good
  You’re too good to be true

  I think you know it
  Too cool to show it
  Babe, you’re so good
  You’re too good to be true
  I think you know it
  Too cool to show it
  Babe, you’re so good
  You’re too good to be true

  Oh, oh, oh, oh
  Why do we make the simplest things so hard?
  Oh, oh, oh, oh
  Why do we make the simplest things so hard?

  Oh, oh, oh, oh
  Sunspots in your eyes, dark green
  You still mean the world to me
  Oh, oh, oh, oh
  Why do we make the simplest things so hard?

  Why do we make the simplest things so hard?
