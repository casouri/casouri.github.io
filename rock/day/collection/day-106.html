          <p>Why do we make the simplest things so hard?</p>
          <p>I bought you breakfast and you started your rings
          <br>
          The air was fragrant and thick with our silence
          <br>
          I held my breath as something deep inside pinched
          <br>
          I touched the bump on your wrist you were born with</p>
          <p>Watching you trying to push away
          <br>
          It hurts when you see it coming
          <br>
          You’re too proud to tell me that you care
          <br>
          Watching you trying to push away
          <br>
          It hurts when you see it coming
          <br>
          Never use your words to show you care</p>
          <p>I think you know it
          <br>
          Too cool to show it
          <br>
          Babe, you’re so good
          <br>
          You’re too good to be true
          <br>
          I think you know it
          <br>
          Too cool to show it
          <br>
          Babe, you’re so good
          <br>
          You’re too good to be true</p>
          <p>Oh, oh, oh, oh
          <br>
          Why do we make the simplest things so hard?</p>
          <p>I let my pain out through the way that I sit
          <br>
          And start to pick at the rips in my Nikes
          <br>
          You quote Thom Yorke and lean in for a quick kiss
          <br>
          But still you just won’t admit that you like me</p>
          <p>Watching you lower both your eyes
          <br>
          It hurts when you know it’s over
          <br>
          Still too stubborn to show that you care
          <br>
          Watching you lower both your eyes
          <br>
          It hurts when you know it’s over
          <br>
          I feel like you never really cared</p>
          <p>I think you know it
          <br>
          Too cool to show it
          <br>
          Babe, you’re so good
          <br>
          You’re too good to be true
          <br>
          I think you know it
          <br>
          Too cool to show it
          <br>
          Babe, you’re so good
          <br>
          You’re too good to be true</p>
          <p>I think you know it
          <br>
          Too cool to show it
          <br>
          Babe, you’re so good
          <br>
          You’re too good to be true
          <br>
          I think you know it
          <br>
          Too cool to show it
          <br>
          Babe, you’re so good
          <br>
          You’re too good to be true</p>
          <p>Oh, oh, oh, oh
          <br>
          Why do we make the simplest things so hard?
          <br>
          Oh, oh, oh, oh
          <br>
          Why do we make the simplest things so hard?</p>
          <p>Oh, oh, oh, oh
          <br>
          Sunspots in your eyes, dark green
          <br>
          You still mean the world to me
          <br>
          Oh, oh, oh, oh
          <br>
          Why do we make the simplest things so hard?</p>
