家母看不上这种嗓音，明明超棒（

Janis 即使唱这种比较舒缓的歌也很有力量，感觉内里有暗流涌动翻腾。

◊lyrics{
Summertime, time, time,
Child, the living's easy
Fish are jumping out
And the cotton, Lord,
Cotton's high, Lord so high

Your daddy's rich
And your ma is so good-looking, baby
She's a-looking good now,
Hush, baby, baby, baby, baby now,
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Don't you cry, don't you cry

One of these mornings
You're gonna rise, rise up singing,
You're gonna spread your wings, child,
And take, take to the sky,
Lord, the sky

But until that morning,
Honey, n-n-nothing's going to harm ya,
No, no, no no, no no, no,
Don't you cry, don't you cry
