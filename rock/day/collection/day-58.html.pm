Backed by The Menahan Street Band. Live from Mellow Johnny's Bike Shop in Austin, TX, during KEXP's broadcast at SXSW. Recorded 3/17/2011.

之前找◊jpns{「たそがれ」}的时候不是加了个分享盗版音乐的 reddit 组嘛，之后那个组里有人分享 Black Puma 的专辑，reddit 给我推送了。所以我就去油管听听看，然后推荐列表里有这场表演的视频。

演唱虽然没啥技巧，但很有力量和情感，同时又很平稳，感觉还不错。

◊lyrics{
Why is it so hard
To make it in America
I try so hard
To make it in America

A land of milk and honey
A land supposed to be built with love
It take love and understanding
To live and let live

I was born in Gainesville Florida
I traveled far and wide
Then I moved to Brooklyn, New York
Had hard times, for sometime I hold on

Why is it so hard
To make it in America
I try so hard
To make it in America

Seemed like nothing was goin' right
So I said to myself
You got to move away from here
I went to upstate New York
A little town they call Poughkeepsie
Got me a job
To get away from all this stress
But I couldn't get away
No matter how far I went
Seems like nothing gonna change
Everything still remained the same

Why is it so hard
To make it in America
I try so hard
To make it in America

Why, tell me, tell me
We gotta make a change, in America
Help me somebody
