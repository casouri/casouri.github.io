        <div class="lyrics">
          <p>Well, I used to wake the mornin'
          <br>
          Before the rooster crowed
          <br>
          Searchin' for soda bottles
          <br>
          To get myself some dough
          <br>
          Brought 'em down to the corner
          <br>
          Down to the country store
          <br>
          Cash 'em in, and give my money
          <br>
          To a man named Curtis Loew</p>
          <p>Old Curt was a black man
          <br>
          With white curly hair
          <br>
          When he had a fifth of wine
          <br>
          He did not have a care
          <br>
          He used to own an old Dobro
          <br>
          Used to play it 'cross his knee
          <br>
          I'd give old Curt my money
          <br>
          He'd play all day for me</p>
          <p>Play me a song
          <br>
          Curtis Loew, Curtis Loew
          <br>
          Well, I got your drinkin' money
          <br>
          Tune up your Dobro
          <br>
          People said he was useless
          <br>
          Them people all were fools
          <br>
          'Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker
          <br>
          To ever play the blues</p>
          <p>He looked to be sixty
          <br>
          And maybe I was ten
          <br>
          Mama used to whoop me
          <br>
          But I'd go see him again
          <br>
          I'd clap my hands, stomp my feet
          <br>
          Try to stay in time
          <br>
          He'd play me a song or two
          <br>
          Then take another drink of wine</p>
          <p>Play me a song
          <br>
          Curtis Loew, Curtis Loew
          <br>
          Well, I got your drinkin' money
          <br>
          Tune up your Dobro
          <br>
          People said he was useless
          <br>
          Them people all were fools
          <br>
          'Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker
          <br>
          To ever play the blues</p>
          <p>Yes, sir</p>
          <p>On the day old Curtis died
          <br>
          Nobody came to pray
          <br>
          Ol' preacher said some words
          <br>
          And they chunked him in the clay
          <br>
          Well, he lived a lifetime
          <br>
          Playin' the black man's blues
          <br>
          And on the day he lost his life
          <br>
          That's all he had to lose</p>
          <p>Play me a song
          <br>
          Curtis Loew, hey Curtis Loew
          <br>
          I wish that you was here so
          <br>
          Everyone would know
          <br>
          People said he was useless
          <br>
          Them people all were fools
          <br>
          'Cause Curtis you're the finest picker
          <br>
          To ever play the blues</p>
