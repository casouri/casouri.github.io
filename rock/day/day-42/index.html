    <p>虽然没有 Janis Joplin 那么震撼，但是也几乎不遑多让了。<span class=

        <p>I heard church bells ringing
        <br>
        I heard a choir singing
        <br>
        I saw my love walk down the aisle
        <br>
        On her finger he placed a ring</p>
        <p>Oh, I saw them holding hands
        <br>
        She was standing there with my man
        <br>
        I heard them promise "Till death do us part"
        <br>
        Each word was a pain in my heart</p>
        <p>All I could do, all I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry)
        <br>
        All I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry)
        <br>
        I was losing the man that I loved
        <br>
        And all I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry)</p>
        <p>Yeah and now the wedding's over
        <br>
        Rice, rice has been thrown over their heads
        <br>
        For them life has just begun
        <br>
        But mine is at an end</p>
        <p>All, all I could do, all I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry)
        <br>
        All I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry)
        <br>
        I was losing the man that I loved (cry, cry, cry)
        <br>
        And all I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry)</p>
