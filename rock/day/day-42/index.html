<b>Etta James - <a href="https://youtu.be/8sMb7QP78Vw">All I Could Do Was Cry</a> - 1960</b>
</p>

<p>
虽然没有Janis Joplin那么震撼，但是也几乎不遑多让了。
</p>

<hr/><div class="lyrics">
<p>
I heard church bells ringing <br />
I heard a choir singing <br />
I saw my love walk down the aisle <br />
On her finger he placed a ring <br />
 <br />
Oh, I saw them holding hands <br />
She was standing there with my man <br />
I heard them promise "Till death do us part" <br />
Each word was a pain in my heart <br />
 <br />
All I could do, all I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry) <br />
All I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry) <br />
I was losing the man that I loved <br />
And all I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry) <br />
 <br />
Yeah and now the wedding's over <br />
Rice, rice has been thrown over their heads <br />
For them life has just begun <br />
But mine is at an end <br />
 <br />
All, all I could do, all I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry) <br />
All I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry) <br />
I was losing the man that I loved (cry, cry, cry) <br />
And all I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry) <br />
