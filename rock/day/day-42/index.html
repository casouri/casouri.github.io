          <p>I heard church bells ringing
          <br>
          I heard a choir singing
          <br>
          I saw my love walk down the aisle
          <br>
          On her finger he placed a ring</p>
          <p>Oh, I saw them holding hands
          <br>
          She was standing there with my man
          <br>
          I heard them promise "Till death do us part"
          <br>
          Each word was a pain in my heart</p>
          <p>All I could do, all I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry)
          <br>
          All I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry)
          <br>
          I was losing the man that I loved
          <br>
          And all I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry)</p>
          <p>Yeah and now the wedding's over
          <br>
          Rice, rice has been thrown over their heads
          <br>
          For them life has just begun
          <br>
          But mine is at an end</p>
          <p>All, all I could do, all I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry)
          <br>
          All I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry)
          <br>
          I was losing the man that I loved (cry, cry, cry)
          <br>
          And all I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry)</p>
