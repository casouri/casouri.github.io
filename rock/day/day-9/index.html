<b>Lynyrd Skynyrd - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSvKkMs2ieo">The Ballad of Curtis Loew</a> - 1974</b>
</p>

<div class="lyrics">
<p>
Well, I used to wake the mornin' <br />
Before the rooster crowed <br />
Searchin' for soda bottles <br />
To get myself some dough <br />
Brought 'em down to the corner <br />
Down to the country store <br />
Cash 'em in, and give my money <br />
To a man named Curtis Loew <br />
 <br />
Old Curt was a black man <br />
With white curly hair <br />
When he had a fifth of wine <br />
He did not have a care <br />
He used to own an old Dobro <br />
Used to play it 'cross his knee <br />
I'd give old Curt my money <br />
He'd play all day for me <br />
 <br />
Play me a song <br />
Curtis Loew, Curtis Loew <br />
Well, I got your drinkin' money <br />
Tune up your Dobro <br />
People said he was useless <br />
Them people all were fools <br />
'Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker <br />
To ever play the blues <br />
 <br />
He looked to be sixty <br />
And maybe I was ten <br />
Mama used to whoop me <br />
But I'd go see him again <br />
I'd clap my hands, stomp my feet <br />
Try to stay in time <br />
He'd play me a song or two <br />
Then take another drink of wine <br />
 <br />
Play me a song <br />
Curtis Loew, Curtis Loew <br />
Well, I got your drinkin' money <br />
Tune up your Dobro <br />
People said he was useless <br />
Them people all were fools <br />
'Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker <br />
To ever play the blues <br />
 <br />
Yes, sir <br />
 <br />
On the day old Curtis died <br />
Nobody came to pray <br />
Ol' preacher said some words <br />
And they chunked him in the clay <br />
Well, he lived a lifetime <br />
Playin' the black man's blues <br />
And on the day he lost his life <br />
That's all he had to lose <br />
 <br />
Play me a song <br />
Curtis Loew, hey Curtis Loew <br />
I wish that you was here so <br />
Everyone would know <br />
People said he was useless <br />
Them people all were fools <br />
'Cause Curtis you're the finest picker <br />
To ever play the blues <br />
