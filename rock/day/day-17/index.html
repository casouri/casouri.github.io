<p>
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son? <br />
Oh, where have you been, my darling young one? <br />
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains <br />
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways <br />
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests <br />
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans <br />
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard <br />
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard <br />
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall <br />
 <br />
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son? <br />
Oh, what did you see, my darling young one? <br />
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it <br />
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it <br />
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin' <br />
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin' <br />
I saw a white ladder all covered with water <br />
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken <br />
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children <br />
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard <br />
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall <br />
 <br />
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son? <br />
And what did you hear, my darling young one? <br />
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin' <br />
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world <br />
Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin' <br />
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter <br />
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley <br />
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard <br />
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall <br />
 <br />
Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son? <br />
Who did you meet, my darling young one? <br />
I met a young child beside a dead pony <br />
I met a white man who walked a black dog <br />
I met a young woman whose body was burning <br />
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow <br />
I met one man who was wounded in love <br />
I met another man who was wounded with hatred <br />
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard <br />
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall <br />
 <br />
Oh, what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son? <br />
Oh, what'll you do now, my darling young one? <br />
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin' <br />
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest <br />
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty <br />
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters <br />
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison <br />
Where the executioner's face is always well-hidden <br />
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten <br />
Where black is the color, where none is the number <br />
And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it <br />
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it <br />
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin' <br />
But I'll know my song well before I start singin' <br />
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard <br />
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall <br />
