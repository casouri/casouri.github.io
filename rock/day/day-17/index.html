    <p>挺伤心的一首歌。Bob Dylan 的歌我听得比较少，或者说，听得不够。有时间一定补一补。</p><p>&lt;2021-06-16 Wed 03:50&gt; 他应该是19年得了诺贝尔文学奖，我不懂文学，但是我觉得颁给他没问题，看看下面的歌词！</p><div><hr/><div class="lyrics"><p>Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?<br/>Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?<br/>I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains<br/>I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways<br/>I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests<br/>I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans<br/>I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard<br/>And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard<br/>And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall</p><p>Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?<br/>Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?<br/>I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it<br/>I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it<br/>I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'<br/>I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'<br/>I saw a white ladder all covered with water<br/>I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken<br/>I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children<br/>And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard<br/>And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall</p><p>And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?<br/>And what did you hear, my darling young one?<br/>I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin'<br/>Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world<br/>Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'<br/>Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter<br/>Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley<br/>And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard<br/>And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall</p><p>Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?<br/>Who did you meet, my darling young one?<br/>I met a young child beside a dead pony<br/>I met a white man who walked a black dog<br/>I met a young woman whose body was burning<br/>I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow<br/>I met one man who was wounded in love<br/>I met another man who was wounded with hatred<br/>And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard<br/>It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall</p><p>Oh, what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?<br/>Oh, what'll you do now, my darling young one?<br/>I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'<br/>I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest<br/>Where the people are many and their hands are all empty<br/>Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters<br/>Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison<br/>Where the executioner's face is always well-hidden<br/>Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten<br/>Where black is the color, where none is the number<br/>And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it<br/>And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it<br/>Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'<br/>But I'll know my song well before I start singin'<br/>And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard<br/>It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall</p></div></div>
