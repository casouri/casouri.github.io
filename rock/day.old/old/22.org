Summertime, time, time,
Child, the living's easy
Fish are jumping out
And the cotton, Lord,
Cotton's high, Lord so high

Your daddy's rich
And your ma is so good-looking, baby
She's a-looking good now,
Hush, baby, baby, baby, baby now,
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Don't you cry, don't you cry

One of these mornings
You're gonna rise, rise up singing,
You're gonna spread your wings, child,
And take, take to the sky,
Lord, the sky

But until that morning,
Honey, n-n-nothing's going to harm ya,
No, no, no no, no no, no,
Don't you cry, don't you cry
