*Buffalo Springfield - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp5JCrSXkJY][For What It's Worth]] - 1966*

我第一次听到这首歌是在《战争之王》里，是电影的片头曲。

{{{BEGIN_LYRICS}}}
There's something happening here \\
What it is ain't exactly clear \\
There's a man with a gun over there \\
Telling me I got to beware \\
 \\
I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound \\
Everybody look what's going down \\
 \\
There's battle lines being drawn \\
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong \\
Young people speaking their minds \\
Getting so much resistance from behind \\
 \\
It's time we stop, hey, what's that sound \\
Everybody look what's going down \\
 \\
What a field-day for the heat \\
A thousand people in the street \\
Singing songs and carrying signs \\
Mostly say, hooray for our side \\
 \\
It's s time we stop, hey, what's that sound \\
Everybody look what's going down \\
 \\
Paranoia strikes deep \\
Into your life it will creep \\
It starts when you're always afraid \\
You step out of line, the man come and take you away \\
 \\
We better stop, hey, what's that sound \\
Everybody look what's going down \\
Stop, hey, what's that sound \\
Everybody look what's going down \\
Stop, now, what's that sound \\
Everybody look what's going down \\
Stop, children, what's that sound \\
Everybody look what's going down \\
