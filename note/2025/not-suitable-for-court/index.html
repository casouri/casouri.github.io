<h1 class="main-title">“This Information is Not Suitable for Use in
Court”</h1>
</div>
<p>I learned from an <a id="footref:article" class=
"footref-anchor obviously-a-link" aria-label="Jump to footnote" href=
"#footdef%3Aarticle">article<sup class="inline-footref">1</sup></a>
<a id="footref:today" class="footref-anchor obviously-a-link" aria-label=
"Jump to footnote" href="#footdef%3Atoday">today<sup class=
"inline-footref">2</sup></a> that US Navy Observatory has a website that
tells you the time of sunrise and sunset, etc, but under the disclaimer
that this information is not suitable for use in court. It’s kind of
interesting; basically, legal matters require credibility and
accountability.</p>
<div id="footdef:article" class="footdef">
<div class="def-footref obviously-a-link"><a aria-label=
"Jump back to main text" href="#footref%3Aarticle">1</a></div>
<div class="def-footdef"><a href=
"https://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/entry/23"><em>What Colour are your

the digital world.</div>
</div>
<div id="footdef:today" class="footdef">
<div class="def-footref obviously-a-link"><a aria-label=

<div class="def-footdef">I wrote the original draft in &lt;2023-02-15 Wed
20:24&gt;, so “today” means that date.</div>
</div>
<p>These two things, in general, means a real person is behind and it is
their credibility as a person that the credibility of the information is
based on. Their credibility in turn comes from other people: their
colleagues, their teacher, their license which are endorsed by people or
institutions made by human. The point is, in a society of human,
credibility ultimately comes from other humans.</p>
<p>This observation applies in so many more places. Take the Internet for
an example, the international <a id="footref:pki" class=
"footref-anchor obviously-a-link" aria-label="Jump to footnote" href=
"#footdef%3Apki">public key infrastructure<sup class=
"inline-footref">3</sup></a> protects the authenticity of web pages
served though <span class="smallcaps">https</span>: every browser vendor
ships their browser with a set of root certificates that are trusted.
Then, when a web server shows you their certificate, and the certificated
can be traced back to one of the trusted root certificates, you know it’s
legit. But how does the web browser vendors know what root certificates
to include? “Every trust chain ends in meatspace”—said in the previously
linked article. The vendors attend committees and conferences, there they
meet people and get to know them, and these people figure out what root
certificates goes into the browsers.</p>
<p>Not only browsers, the whole internet is build upon connections
between human. The internet is made of numerous interconnected networks
(<a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)"><span class=
"smallcaps">as</span></a>) managed by different entities. Your internet
provider manages the network your house is in, and they have a connection
to Google’s network. In very simplistic term, to participate in the
internet, you only need to know someone that has connections to other
<span class="smallcaps">as</span>’s, get yourself some <span class=
"smallcaps">ip</span> addresses, connect your router to their router, and
start advertising your <span class="smallcaps">ip</span> addresses. Other
routers on the internet will learn your address thought their connections
to other routers, and they will send packets addressed to your address to
your router.</p>
<div id="footdef:pki" class="footdef">
<div class="def-footref obviously-a-link"><a aria-label=
"Jump back to main text" href="#footref%3Apki">3</a></div>
<div class="def-footdef"><a href=
"https://smallstep.com/blog/everything-pki/"><em>Everything you should
know about certificates and PKI but are too afraid to ask</em></a>, if
you are a programmer and want to know what’s going on under the
hood.</div>
</div>
<p>It is entirely possible for someone on the internet to go rogue and
start advertising other people’s address and <a id="footref:bgp" class=
"footref-anchor obviously-a-link" aria-label="Jump to footnote" href=
"#footdef%3Abgp">routers on the internet will just take it<sup class=
"inline-footref">4</sup></a>, and that has actually happend. The whole
system depends on one <span class="smallcaps">as</span> trusting its
neighbors and its neighbor trusting their neighbors, again, through trust
formed in meatspace.</p>
<div id="footdef:bgp" class="footdef">
<div class="def-footref obviously-a-link"><a aria-label=
"Jump back to main text" href="#footref%3Abgp">4</a></div>
<div class="def-footdef">There is talk about “secure <span class=
"smallcaps">bgp</span>”, but it’s far from becoming reality.</div>
</div>
<p>The point is, I guess, look pass the machine. The machine, or whatever
technology, doesn’t have agency by itself, it is always created and
controlled by human. You are not trusting your browser or its root
certificates, you are trusting Mozilla, Google and Apple; you are
trusting the human at Mozilla, Google, and Apple to do their job and have
good intentions. Really, human is the only actor in this society,
military are made of human, lawmakers are human, lawenforcement are made
of human, so if everyone in a society think something needs to change, it
will change. If all the people think someone is innocent or guilty but
shouldn’t be punished, they can just walk; if all the people think a law
is stupid, it’ll be changed. It’s that easy. Things that seems
unchangeable can be easily changed if enough people’s mind are
swayed.</p>
<p>Maybe a tangent but often we hear about this technologism that says if
we just keep advancing technology we’ll solve this or that problem. If we
just build more homes we’ll make housing affordable. Or the reverse where
people says this or that technology is bad and is ruining our lifes. But
a lot of time the problem is not the technology, a lot of time it’s a
societal problem.</p>
<p>Actually, I don’t know what I’m trying to say because these are just
some random thoughts emerged from the two linked articles. But at least I
shred some cool facts about the internet :-)</p>
