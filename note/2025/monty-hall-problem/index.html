<h1 class="main-title">Monty Hall Problem</h1>
</div>
<p>When I first heard about Monty Hall problem, I found it very hard to
convince myself of the solution. And when I encountered it again a few
days ago, lo and behold, I fell for it again. This time I want to make
sure I’m absolutely crystal-clear convinced, so I won’t fall for it yet
again.</p>
<p>Cognitive psychologists think people fell for the problem because of
endowment effect, status quo bias, and errors of omission vs errors of
commission effect. I think they’re full of shit. I think the reason why
people fall for it, even educated ones, is that the correct solution
looks damn like a statistics fallacy sold with snake oil. Even the
follow-up explanation that’s supposed to clear it up looks so
suspicious:</p>
<blockquote>Suppose there are a million doors, and you pick door
<span class="oldstyle-num">#1</span>. Then the host, who knows what’s
behind the doors and will always avoid the one with the prize, opens them
all except door <span class="oldstyle-num">#777,777</span>. You’d switch
to that door pretty fast, wouldn’t you?</blockquote>
<p>And people who are convinced after reading it looks like they’re
tricked. Yeah, the host knows which door has the car and have to avoid
it, so they added information by choosing to open all the doors except
<span class="oldstyle-num">#777,777</span>. But how does that affect the
odd of the <span class="oldstyle-num">#777,777</span>?</p>
<p>To make it more concrete and finally convince myself, let’s go over
this one million door analogy with numbers. Suppose there are
<span class="oldstyle-num">100</span> doors, one of them have a car
behind, and the rest have goats behind. You randomly pick a door. The
host, who knows which door has the car behind and can only open doors
with a goat, opens <span class="oldstyle-num">98</span> doors.</p>
<p>Now let’s think about the probability of the two remaining doors of
having a car behind. Let the door you picked be M, let the other closed
door be N. You picked M randomly, so the probability for M to have a car
is <span class="oldstyle-num">1/100</span>. For N, before the host opens
any doors, the probability for N to have a car is also <span class=
"oldstyle-num">1/100</span>.</p>
<p>After the host opened <span class="oldstyle-num">98</span> doors, the
probability of M to have a car is still <span class=
"oldstyle-num">1/100</span>. That means the probability of the rest of
<span class="oldstyle-num">99</span> doors having the car is <span class=
"oldstyle-num">99/100</span>. Conveniently, the host has eliminated
<span class="oldstyle-num">98</span> of them. So if there is a car in
these <span class="oldstyle-num">99</span> doors, it has to be in N. So
picking N is the same as picking the rest of 99, and the probability for
N to have the car is <span class="oldstyle-num">99/100</span>.</p>
<p>Basically, choosing between switch and non-switch is like choosing
between <span class="oldstyle-num">99</span> doors and 1 door. If you
choose the <span class="oldstyle-num">99</span> doors and the car is in
one of them, the host basically just tells you which door has the
car.</p>
<p>Apologies to cognitive psychologists, they’re obviously not full of
shit. But it’s funny to said it like that.</p>
