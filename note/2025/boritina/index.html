<p>I’ve always been kind of a type enthusiast, and naturally I dream
about making a typeface myself. So when Letterform Archive here in SF
opened an online introductory type design course last summer, I snatched
the opportunity ans signed up. It was hella fun, and hella grind. I would
start working on the font after I get off work and not stop until
midnight. Kind of addicting, honestly—seeing a font steadily taking
shape, and stare at the beautiful letters and think “I made it”.</p>
<p>The instructor <a href=
"https://www.instagram.com/keltroughton">Kel</a> and <span class=
"smallcaps">ta</span> <a href=
"https://www.instagram.com/thetypefella">Josh</a> are so nice and
supportive, and they definitely knows their sh..tuff. The classmates are
all so cool and creative. It’s so fun to get to know artists, when you
interact with mostly engineers everyday. One of the classmates, Brian,
actually started doing type: <a href=
"https://www.instagram.com/fusion_type">Fusion Type</a>!</p>
<p>When the course ended I finished the lower and upper case, lining and
oldstyle numbers, some symbols and basic diacritics. After the course I
didn’t touch it for a few weeks, then added some more symbols and started
to add a bold. But eventually the progress almost stalled. I’ve finished
the bold for all the letters but couldn’t get myself to finish the bold
for all those numbers and symbols, and fix kerning for everything. Doubt
starts creeping in—looking at those beautiful and polished typefaces like
<a href="https://www.typotheque.com/fonts/william-text">William</a>,
Clifford, <a href="https://djr.com/fern">Fern</a>, my font looks more and
more like a nervoussplotchy mess that doesn’t know what it wants to be.
By the end of <span class="oldstyle-num">2024</span>, I almost give up
finishing it.</p>
<p>Fast forward to a few days ago, I was reading a newsletter in my mail
client, and noticed that the font looks so pretty! I’ve set the default
font of my mail client to my font (so I can catch errors and tweak the
font in a real setting), but it looked so good that I thought it’s using
some other font that the newsletter brought itself. I had to zoom in and
look at the letters back and forth before certain that it’s using my
font. That encouraged me so much, and I thought I’ll do “get a garbage
out first” and just finish it real quick, don’t dwell on the details.</p>
<p>It’s been a week, I finished bold for numbers and all the symbols,
more-or-less copy-pasted kerning from regular to bold, and added
smallcaps using <a href="https://remix-tools.com">font remix tools</a>.
It’s finally ready to be used on my blog! But it’s definitely not ready
for anybody else to use. I haven’t even asked anybody to review the bold
for me, because I need to make it a bit more presentable first. I just
have to get it out and “finish” it first, I cannot drag this any
longer.</p>

<p>I call this font Boritina, because people seems to name fonts
something-tina a lot, and I want to make a boring body text that only I
find interesting.</p>
<p>Boritina is basically a mixture of all the features I like for a body
text. Before Boritina, I was using <a href=
"https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/martina-plantijn/">Martina Plantijn</a>
for this blog. It’s clean as crystal, and has the color I like, but I can
envision something that has a bit more flair like a classic Venetian
typeface—the slanted bar of e, the longer stems, the extended tail of Q,
the warmer feeling, the dagger, etc. On the other hand, old Venetian
often are too thin and delicate, and a x-height as low as classic
Venetians is a bit inconvenient for modern settings now. I want the
robustness of Plantin, and other modern features so the font doesn’t look
out-of-place even for a technical blog like this one.</p>
<p>I stole the skeleton from Jenson’s roman, but relaxed the aperture and
shortened the x-height. I kept the wide H, N, C, D, and the tail of R and
Q. The rest I just went with my preference.</p>
<p>To see the font in action, well, you’ve been seeing it in action,
since this blog now uses Boritina (it still uses Margina Plantijn for
italics). I might make a specimen/showcase page for Boritina later.</p>
