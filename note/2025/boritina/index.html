<p>I’ve always been kind of a type enthusiast, and naturally I dream
about making a typeface myself. So when Letterform Archive here in SF
opened an online introductory type design course last summer, I snatched
the opportunity and signed up. It was hella fun, and hella grind. I would
start working on the font after I get off work and not stop until
midnight. Kind of addicting, honestly—seeing a font steadily taking
shape, and stare at the beautiful letters and think “I made it”.</p>
<p>The instructor <a href=
"https://www.instagram.com/keltroughton">Kel</a> and <span class=
"smallcaps">ta</span> <a href=
"https://www.instagram.com/thetypefella">Josh</a> are so nice and
supportive, and they definitely knows their sh..tuff. The classmates are
all so cool and creative. It’s so fun to get to know artists, when you
interact with mostly engineers everyday. One of the classmates, Brian,
actually started doing type: <a href=
"https://www.instagram.com/fusion_type">Fusion Type</a>!</p>
<p>When the course ended I finished the lower and upper case, lining and
oldstyle numbers, some symbols and basic diacritics. After the course I
didn’t touch it for a few weeks, then added some more symbols and started
to add a bold. But eventually the progress almost stalled. I’ve finished
the bold for all the letters but couldn’t get myself to finish the bold
for all those numbers and symbols, and fix kerning for everything. Doubt
also starts creeping in—looking at those beautiful and polished typefaces
like <a href="https://www.typotheque.com/fonts/william-text">William</a>,
Clifford, <a href="https://djr.com/fern">Fern</a>, my font looks more and
more like a nervous splotchy mess that doesn’t know what it wants to be.
By the end of <span class="oldstyle-num">2024</span>, I almost give up
finishing it.</p>
<p>Fast forward to a few days ago, I was reading a newsletter in my mail
client, and noticed that the font looks so pretty! I’ve set the default
font of my mail client to my font (so I can catch errors and tweak the
font in a real setting), but it looked so good that I thought it’s using
some other font that the newsletter brought itself. I had to zoom in and
look at the letters back and forth before certain that it’s using my
font. That encouraged me so much, and I thought I’ll do the “get a
garbage out first” strat and just finish it real quick, not dwell on
anything, and if I can’t make something work, I’ll just skip it.</p>
<p>It’s been a week, I finished bold for numbers and all the symbols,
more-or-less copy-pasted kerning from regular to bold, and added
smallcaps using <a href="https://remix-tools.com">font remix tools</a>.
It’s finally ready to be used on my blog! Though definitely not ready for
anybody else to use. I haven’t even asked anybody to review the bold for
me, because I don’t think it’s presentable for review right now.</p>

<p>I call this font Boritina, because people seems to name fonts
something-tina a lot, and I want to make a boring body text.</p>
<p>Boritina is basically a mixture of all the features I like for a body
text. Before Boritina, I was using <a href=
"https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/martina-plantijn/">Martina Plantijn</a>
for this blog. It’s clean as crystal, and has the color I like, but I can
envision something that has a bit more flair like a classic Venetian
typeface—the slanted bar of e, the longer stems, the extended tail of Q,
the warmer feeling, the dagger, etc. On the other hand, old Venetian
often are too thin and delicate, and a x-height as low as classic
Venetian’s is a bit inconvenient for modern settings. I want the
robustness of Plantin, and other modern features so the font doesn’t look
out-of-place even for a technical blog like this one.</p>
<p>I stole the skeleton from Jenson’s roman, but relaxed the aperture and
shortened the x-height. I also maintained a low contrast, and kept a tiny
bit of remnant of pen strokes, so the font captures that humane warmth
but doesn’t appear too old. The curves are largely very simplistic, but I
added a tiny bit of personality in the bowl of B, R, and D, and in the
serif of G and S. So when you look up close, it’s not completely dull.
<a id="footref:Qtail" class="footref-anchor obviously-a-link" aria-label=
"Jump to footnote" href="#footdef%3AQtail">R J Q t all have extended
tails<sup class="inline-footref">1</sup></a>, which I like; together with
the wider capitals, they make the font spacious and extended and
comfortable—some of the “workhorse” body text typefaces tends to have
very short descenders and cramped tails and feet, which I sometimes find
a bit undesirable. In this day and age, page count isn’t an issue
anymore, so I say we deserve some more room.</p>
<div id="footdef:Qtail" class="footdef">
<div class="def-footref obviously-a-link"><a aria-label=
"Jump back to main text" href="#footref%3AQtail">1</a></div>
<div class="def-footdef">Q’s tail gives me a lot of trouble, I have to
create a version with a shorter tail and replace it in when the long tail
will collide with the glyph after. For example: QJ, Q, Qg. Fortunately
it’s quite rare for Q to be followed by these kind of characters in
English.</div>
</div>
<p>Initially I created star-shaped periods, like Jenson’s roman had. But
Kel talked me out of it. I kept it as a stylistic set for occasions that
require som extra flair. I also started with a slightly slanted dash, but
finally decided a flat one is more fitting for modern settings. (Also,
flat dash makes better smiley faces :-)</p>
<p>Another guardrail—or limitation, depends on how you see it—that I set
for myself is to make the counterspace as pretty as the strokes are. If
you look at the inside of h, n, m, the triangles of x, v, y, w, the bowl
of b, p, q, d, or inside and around the capitals, you’ll find them to be
pretty shapes.</p>
<p>To see the font in action, well, you’ve been seeing it in action,
since this blog now uses Boritina (it still uses Margina Plantijn for
italics). I might make a specimen/showcase page for Boritina later.</p>
