◊section{The story}

I’ve always been kind of a type enthusiast, and naturally I dream about making a typeface myself. So when Letterform Archive here in SF opened an online introductory type design course last summer, I snatched the opportunity ans signed up. It was hella fun, and hella grind. I would start working on the font after I get off work and not stop until midnight. Kind of addicting, honestly—seeing a font steadily taking shape, and stare at the beautiful letters and think “I made it”.

The instructor ◊link["https://www.instagram.com/keltroughton"]{Kel} and ◊sc{ta} ◊link["https://www.instagram.com/thetypefella"]{Josh} are so nice and supportive, and they definitely knows their sh..tuff. The classmates are all so cool and creative. It’s so fun to get to know artists, when you interact with mostly engineers everyday. One of the classmates, Brian, actually started doing type: ◊link["https://www.instagram.com/fusion_type"]{Fusion Type}!

When the course ended I finished the lower and upper case, lining and oldstyle numbers, some symbols and basic diacritics. After the course I didn’t touch it for a few weeks, then added some more symbols and started to add a bold. But eventually the progress almost stalled. I’ve finished the bold for all the letters but couldn’t get myself to finish the bold for all those numbers and symbols, and fix kerning for everything. Doubt starts creeping in—looking at those beautiful and polished typefaces like ◊link["https://www.typotheque.com/fonts/william-text"]{William}, Clifford, ◊link["https://djr.com/fern"]{Fern}, my font looks more and more like a nervoussplotchy mess that doesn’t know what it wants to be. By the end of ◊om{2024}, I almost give up finishing it.

Fast forward to a few days ago, I was reading a newsletter in my mail client, and noticed that the font looks so pretty! I’ve set the default font of my mail client to my font (so I can catch errors and tweak the font in a real setting), but it looked so good that I thought it’s using some other font that the newsletter brought itself. I had to zoom in and look at the letters back and forth before certain that it’s using my font. That encouraged me so much, and I thought I’ll do “get a garbage out first” and just finish it real quick, don’t dwell on the details.

It’s been a week, I finished bold for numbers and all the symbols, more-or-less copy-pasted kerning from regular to bold, and added smallcaps using ◊link["https://remix-tools.com"]{font remix tools}. It’s finally ready to be used on my blog! But it’s definitely not ready for anybody else to use. I haven’t even asked anybody to review the bold for me, because I need to make it a bit more presentable first. I just have to get it out and “finish” it first, I cannot drag this any longer.

◊section{The font}

I call this font Boritina, because people seems to name fonts something-tina a lot, and I want to make a boring body text that only I find interesting.

Boritina is basically a mixture of all the features I like for a body text. Before Boritina, I was using ◊link["https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/martina-plantijn/"]{Martina Plantijn} for this blog. It’s clean as crystal, and has the color I like, but I can envision something that has a bit more flair like a classic Venetian typeface—the slanted bar of e, the longer stems, the extended tail of Q, the warmer feeling, the dagger, etc. On the other hand, old Venetian often are too thin and delicate, and a x-height as low as classic Venetians is a bit inconvenient for modern settings now. I want the robustness of Plantin, and other modern features so the font doesn’t look out-of-place even for a technical blog like this one.

I stole the skeleton from Jenson’s roman, but relaxed the aperture and shortened the x-height. I kept the wide H, N, C, D, and the tail of R and Q. The rest I just went with my preference.

To see the font in action, well, you’ve been seeing it in action, since this blog now uses Boritina (it still uses Margina Plantijn for italics). I might make a specimen/showcase page for Boritina later.
