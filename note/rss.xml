<title>Manage Windows in Emacs</title>
<link>https://archive.casouri.co.uk/note/2019/manage-windows-in-emacs/</link>
<description>Managing windows in Emacs seems complicated. There exists a ton of commands and packages and the windows are still messy. From my experience, all you need is the following commands:</description>

<title>Jump Back in Emacs</title>
<link>https://archive.casouri.co.uk/note/2019/jump-back-in-emacs/</link>
<description>It is annoying when you jumped to somewhere, did some operations and couldn’t find the way back and have to scroll back or jump back by searching. There are many position history packages that record your location and let you jump back in time. But in reality they either set too much anchors or didn’t set the anchor you need. Also jumping between anchors are more or less visually confusing because you have to observe where are you after each jump. In a word, the experience is not very good.</description>

<title>Theme and Font in Emacs</title>
<link>https://archive.casouri.co.uk/note/2019/theme-and-font-in-emacs/</link>
<description>Theme and font almost drove me nuts when I first try to configure Emacs by myself (instead of using Spacemacs). They don’t “just work”, at least for me, at that time. In this post I introduce some basic information about themes and font setting in Emacs and how do I configure them.</description>

<title>Reduce Font Loading Time in My Blog</title>
<link>https://archive.casouri.co.uk/note/2019/reduce-font-loading-time-in-my-blog/</link>
<description>I use Source Han Serif on my blogs. And it takes ages to load. Source Serif Pro Regular (an English font) has a size of 217 KB. Source Han Serif Regular? 23.6 MB. I have to reduce the size of the font file!</description>

<title>Rime输入法完全指南</title>
<link>https://archive.casouri.co.uk/note/2019/rime输入法完全指南/</link>
<description>输入法对我来说是很重要的一个工具，它好用与否密切关系到我平时的效率和心
情。Mac自带的输入法虽然勉强可用，平时却总会出现各种小问题。听说了Rime
输入法非常牛逼，我就打算切换到这个输入法。</description>

<title>MacOS Mail Configuration</title>

<description>I walked a big circle and end up with Mail.app. I hope this works for at least a few years. I think the source of all the pain from email clients is the bad email protocol itself, but that is not the topic today.</description>

<title>Emacs Gateway Drug</title>
<link>https://archive.casouri.co.uk/note/2018/emacs-gateway-drug/</link>
<description>Every time I try to introduce my friend Emacs, they ask "why?"
Well I can't really think of anything except "you can do anything you want with it".
Of course that statement is too broad and unconvincing.
So I though I'd collect some cool features that can lure my friends into using Emacs.</description>

<description>Wanderlust is a Emacs email client, I have had enough with Thunderbird and Mail on macOS (Thunderbird uses
a ton of RAM and Mail got werid bugs that no one except me seems have encountered, and both of them
sucks at searching mails),
and apparently Outlook doesn't work on mac, so I'm finally getting my hand dirty with Emacs email client.</description>

<title>Blog with only Org Mode</title>
<link>https://archive.casouri.co.uk/note/2018/blog-with-only-org-mode/</link>
<description>Nowadays you can choose from a handful of static blog frameworks, like hexo, pelican, etc.
Most of them support Markdown, and you can use Org Mode along with them by exporting Org file
to Markdown file. Some framework even has deeper integration. For example the package ox-hugo
provides a dozen advanced export options and well intergrated hugo and Org Mode options/properties.</description>
