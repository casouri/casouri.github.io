<p>I recently upgraded my <span class="smallcaps">pc</span> and started
to use it regularly again. When setting it up, I run into times when it
would be nice to be able to copy something from my laptop to the
<span class="smallcaps">pc</span>. That prompted me to search for a
<span class="smallcaps">lan</span> clipboard sharing program.</p>
<p>I did find a nice one on GitHub written by ascclemens, called <a id=
"footref:lan_clipboard" class="footref-anchor obviously-a-link"
aria-label="Jump to footnote" href=
"#footdef%3Alan_clipboard">lan_clipboard<sup class=
"inline-footref">1</sup></a>. It consists of a server and a client, where
the server synchronizes the clipboard between multiple clients. Better
yet, it uses <span class="smallcaps">tls</span> and certificates to
secure the communication between server and clients.</p>
<p>I could’ve figure out how to generate a set of certificates that it
accepts and just use it, but decided to write one myself, because
reasons. And I ended up with ccbc (Clueless ClipBoard Cluster).</p>
<h2 id="P2P" class="section">P2P</h2>
<p>I didn’t like having a designated server, so I made ccbc <span class=
"oldstyle-num"><span class="smallcaps">p2p</span></span>, where every
node broadcasts changes in its clipboard to every other node. Because by
the nature of clipboard sharing, there is only one active user moving
between hosts, so at any short span of time there should be only one node
having changes in its clipboard. And there should only be a handful of
nodes. So broadcasting makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>There is also absolutely no synchronization or consensus. Nodes just
broadcast their clipboard content when there is a change. They don’t try
to agree on what should be in the clipboard and doesn’t try to make every
host to have the same content in their clipboard.</p>
<p>ccbc also uses <span class="smallcaps">tls</span>. Even better, it can
generate certificates for you, so you don’t need to figure out how to
cast the right openssl spell. And it can fire up a <span class=
"smallcaps">http</span> server that gives out certificates to anyone
connected. This step is completely insecure, but we are in <span class=
"smallcaps">lan</span>, so I’m not really worried about it.</p>
<p>I want ccbc to be able to recover from disconnections, and auto-detect
new peers in the cluster. So here is how it keeps track of peers: Every
node has an unique <em>name</em> (not difficult to manager for a handful
of devices owned by the same person). And every node has a <span class=
"smallcaps">peer list</span>, which is a map from unique names of each
node to its current address (and port).</p>
<p>When a node Alice joins a cluster, it needs to know at least one
peer’s address, let’s call it Bob. Alice will connect to Bob and request
for its peer list. Bob will send Alice its peer list and add Alice to its
peer list. Alice will then connect to every other peer in the peer list.
Peers will send their peer list to each other periodically so under a
simple network topology, everyone should get to know each other
eventually.</p>
<p>When a peer lost connection to another peer, it will keep trying to
connect to it. When a peer disconnects and rejoins the network under
another address, the new address will override the old one in other
peers’ peer list. And naturally the other peers will stop trying to
connect to the old address. This is why we require unique names and don’t
use the address to identify a peer.</p>
<h2 id="Copying%20files" class="section">Copying files</h2>
<p>The library I used to get the content of system clipboard already
supports both text and images, but wouldn’t it be cool if ccbc could copy
files, too? It isn’t hard, either. On Linux (<span class=
"oldstyle-num"><span class="smallcaps">X11</span></span>), if you copy a
file and pull the clipboard content as text (which is what the library
does), you’ll get the paths of those files. I could modify the clipboard
library to identify files and pull them as files, but really, file paths
are good enough, because ccbc can easily tell whether the text it pulled
from the clipboard is ordinary text or a list of file paths: it just
interpret the content as paths and check if they exists.</p>
<p>If the clipboard content are file paths, ccbc will broadcast them as
files to its peers. And if a Peer wants to paste those files, it
downloads those files from the peer that owns those files. For
directories I cheated: I pack them into tars, transfer them, and unpacks
the tar. I don’t expect to use this feature on huge files anyway, there’s
always rsync.</p>
<p>Ideally you want to invoke a command which pastes the files you just
copied on another machine to the current directory. So I added a
subcommand to the ccbc command which creates a client and connects to the
local ccbc daemon and instructs it to download the files from the remote
peer. Better yet, the local daemon will stream the download progress to
the client.</p>
