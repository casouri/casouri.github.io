<h1 class="main-title">“This Information is Not Suitable for Use in
Court”</h1>
</div>
<p>I learned from an <a id="footref:article" class=
"footref-anchor obviously-a-link" aria-label="Jump to footnote" href=
"#footdef%3Aarticle">article<sup class="inline-footref">1</sup></a> today
that US Navy Observatory has a website that tells you the time of sunrise
and sunset, etc, but under the disclaimer that this information is not
suitable for use in court. It’s interesting but not hard to understand:
we all know that legal matters require credibility and
accountability.</p>
<p>These two things, in general, means a real person is behind and it is
their credibility as a person that the credibility of the information is
based on. Their credibility in turn comes from other people: their
colleagues, their teacher, their license which are endorsed by people or
institutions made by human. The point is, in a society of human,
credibility ultimately comes from other humans.</p>
<p>This observation applies to everywhere. Take the Internet for an
example, the international <a id="footref:pki" class=
"footref-anchor obviously-a-link" aria-label="Jump to footnote" href=
"#footdef%3Apki">public key infrastructure<sup class=
"inline-footref">2</sup></a> protects the authenticity of web pages
served though <span class="smallcaps">https</span>: every browser vendor
ships their browser with a set of root certificates that are trusted.
Then, when a web server shows you their certificate, and the certificated
can be traced back to one of the trusted root certificates, you know it’s
legit. But how does the web browser vendors know what root certificates
to include? “Every trust chain ends in meatspace.” The vendors attend
committees and conferences, there they meet people and get to know them,
and these people figure out what root certificates goes into the
browsers.</p>
<p>Not only browsers, the whole internet is build upon connections
between human. The internet is made of numerous interconnected networks
(<a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)"><span class=
"smallcaps">as</span></a>) managed by different entities. Your internet
provider manages the network your house is in, and they have a connection
to Google’s network. In very simplistic term, to participate in the
internet, you only need to know someone that has connections to other
<span class="smallcaps">as</span>’s, get yourself some <span class=
"smallcaps">ip</span> addresses, connect your router to their router, and
start advertising your <span class="smallcaps">ip</span> addresses. Other
routers on the internet will learn your address thought their connections
to other routers, and they will send packets addressed to your address to
your router.</p>
<p>It is entirely possible for someone on the internet to go rogue and
start advertising other people’s address and <a id="footref:bgp" class=
"footref-anchor obviously-a-link" aria-label="Jump to footnote" href=
"#footdef%3Abgp">routers on the internet will just take it<sup class=
"inline-footref">3</sup></a>. The whole system depends on one
<span class="smallcaps">as</span> trusting its neighbors and its neighbor
trusting their neighbors, again, through trust formed in meatspace.</p>
<p>The point is, I guess, “don’t be fooled by the machine”. The machine,
or technology, doesn’t have initiative by itself, it is always
controlled, directly or indirectly, by human. You are not trusting your
browser or its root certificates, you are trusting Mozilla, Google and
Apple; you are trusting the human at Mozilla, Google, and Apple to do
their job and have good intentions.</p>
<p>If we go a bit further, it seems that nothing really matters without
human. Everything in our society revolves around human, and whatever we
interact with, we are ultimately interacting with other human.</p>
<p>If all human on Earth except you disappears tomorrow, and you have
ample resources to live, is such life worth living? If in addition you
gained knowledge of the ultimate questions, but have no one to share it
to, does it matter anymore (beyond the brief enjoyment of acquiring that
knowledge)? If human developed some awesome technology, then proceeds to
disappear (and there is no alien to come discover it), does this awesome
technology matter anymore?</p>
<p>My current stance is that it wouldn’t matter anymore.</p>
