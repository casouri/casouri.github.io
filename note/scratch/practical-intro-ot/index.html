<p>Unfortunately, there isn’t a best algorithm that you can just learn,
implement, and be done with it. There are a bunch of trade-offs, and
subtleties, which I hope to explain in this article, or at least point to
further reads.</p>
<p>A huge disclaimer upfront: I’m not an expert, only someone that read a
bunch of papers and blog posts, so take what I say with a grain of
salt.</p>
<h2 id="What%E2%80%99s%20OT%20&amp;%20CRDT" class="section">What’s OT &
CRDT</h2>
<p>Nowadays you can’t talke about <span class="smallcaps">ot</span>
(operational transformation) without mentioning <span class=
"smallcaps">crdt</span> (conflict-free replicated data types). Broadly
speaking, they are the two approaches to collaborative editing.
<span class="smallcaps">ot</span> is the first to be conceived and
researched on since the <span class="oldstyle-num">90</span>’s.
<span class="smallcaps">crdt</span> is a database/distributed system
concept that was brought into collaborative editing in around
<span class="oldstyle-num">2006</span>. I’ll briefly introduce both and
give them a comparison, before delving into <span class=
"smallcaps">ot</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">ot</span> works by transforming operations
like insert, delete, update, etc. Consider this example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Two users A, B work on a document containing only “x”;</li>
<li>A inserts “a” before “x” (insert “a” at position 0), propagates its
operation to B;</li>
<li>Not yet aware of A’s modification, B deletes “x” (delete at position
0), propagates its operation to A.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now if A applies B’s operation verbatim, it would delete the character
at position 0, which is “a” rather than the intended “x”. The correct way
is to transform B’s deletion so that it deletes at position 1, which
deletes “x”.</p>
<p>This is a trivial example, but things get very complicated very fast
once you mix more concurrent operations and have <span class=
"oldstyle-num">3+</span> users.</p>
<p>The problem, in essence, is that B’s operation is based on document
“x”, but A applied it on document “ax”. Once we transform the operation
to be based on document “ax”, the operation can apply cleanly.</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">crdt</span> is a data type plus a set of
operations, such that operations can be transmitted in different order
and eventually still get the same result, as long as everybody eventually
receives all the operations. Then, you don’t need a central
synchronization, a distributed gossip protocol can ensure that every node
in the system eventually reach the same state. (I omitted some details
for brevity.)</p>
<p>Turns out you can design a <span class="smallcaps">crdt</span> that
represents a document and a set of operations that covers all text
editing operations. You model the document as a series of characters with
unique ids (plus invisible character for beginning and end of the
document), and have two operations: insert after the character with id x,
and hide character with id x.</p>
<p>Take the same example. A’s operation is now “insert after the
beginning of the document”, B’s operation is now “hide character with id
1 (which is character x)”. Note that operations are not position-based
anymore. When A applies B’s operation, it first finds the position of
“the character with id 1”, and deletes it.</p>
<p>You’ll notice that it only has “hide” and no “delete”, because
<span class="smallcaps">crdt</span> handles delete as hide. <span class=
"smallcaps">crdt</span> can’t delete a character since other operations
might need that character as an anchor. (The hidden characters are called
tombstones.)</p>
<h2 id="OT%20vs%20CRDT" class="section">OT vs CRDT</h2>
<p>I’ll say this right off the bat: I don’t think either is strictly
better than the other, they just have different characteristics and
trade-offs. You need to consider the things you absolutely want in your
system to decide which to use.</p>
<p>Collaborative editing is a distributed systems problem, and as
everything else in distributed systems, you can simplify your system by
either centralizing things (so make it less distributed), or you limit
the number of things you can do (limit the functionality). <span class=
"smallcaps">crdt</span> and <span class="smallcaps">ot</span> moves
around these axes of trade-offs.</p>
<p>The advantage of <span class="smallcaps">cdrt</span> is that it’s
relatively simple to make fully distributed. There are many <span class=
"smallcaps">ot</span> algorithms that claims to be distributed, but they
usually have some catch: vector timestamp, requires global
synchronization, bad space/time complexity that scales with number of
nodes in the system, no mention of handling join/leave, etc. (Not to say
there are no truly distributed <span class="smallcaps">ot</span>
algorithms, there are.)</p>
<p>People often credit <span class="smallcaps">crdt</span> for being
simpler than <span class="smallcaps">ot</span>, which it is, <em>on
paper</em>. The papers and algorithms only talk about the concept. But if
you are to actually implement it, and do it efficiently, things get
complicated.</p>
<p>For example, in <span class="smallcaps">crdt</span>, every character
has a unique id. In reality, you’re not going to store a unique id for
every character. You’ll probably use landmarks: the first character in a
range stores an unique id, and the rest are represented as an offset from
that character. Now you are back with position juggling not unlike in
<span class="smallcaps">ot</span>. And when you delete, how do you find
the character with the id? Are you going to scan the whole document? Or
store the document in a balanced tree?</p>
<p>To be fair, <span class="smallcaps">ot</span> is only a little better.
The algorithms on papers are already non-trivial to understand (and to
convince yourself of its correctness); on top of that, they often don’t
directly translate to implementation either (but better than <span class=
"smallcaps">crdt</span>). And once you add synchronization, failure, etc
into the mix, you get just as much headache.</p>

aria-label="Jump to footnote" href="#footdef%3Atiny">People will also say
<span class="smallcaps">crdt</span> can’t work well with rich
text<sup class="inline-footref">1</sup></a>, because it can only handle
insertion and deletion, so it’s difficult for it to preserve user intent
on complicated operations like “add table row”, “mark this piece of text
in the middle as bold”. I tend to agree, considering that all the real
world commercial rich text editors that I know of are implemented in
<span class="smallcaps">ot</span> (<a id="footref:tiny" class=

operations in the application into three primitive operations: insert,

<p>Space complexity: <span class="smallcaps">crdt</span> document keeps
all the characters ever inserted, both visible characters and tombstones.
<span class="smallcaps">ot</span> needs to store all the concurrent
operations. It doesn’t need to store <em>all</em> the operations: once an
operation is known to be applied at all nodes, it can be discarded.</p>
<p>So it seems <span class="smallcaps">ot</span> has better space
complexity in general? Not quite. If you want to make the <span class=
"smallcaps">ot</span> system fully distributed, you’ll have to keep all
the history, since it’s impossible to tell if an operation is applied at
every node when you don’t even know all the nodes. And if you think about
it, “full history” and “all characters even inserted in to the document”

aria-label="Jump to footnote" href="#footdef%3Aundo-history">sounds
familiar, no?<sup class="inline-footref">6</sup></a> I guess the
conclusion is a) if you want full distribution, you need to store a lot
