<p>Unfortunately, there isn’t a best algorithm that you can just learn,
implement, and be done with it. There are a bunch of trade-offs, and
subtleties, which I hope to explain in this article, or at least point to
further reads.</p>
<p>A huge disclaimer upfront: I’m not an expert, only someone that read a
bunch of papers and blog posts, so take what I say with a grain of
salt.</p>
<h2 id="What%E2%80%99s%20OT%20&amp;%20CRDT" class="section">What’s OT &
CRDT</h2>
<p>Nowadays you can’t talke about <span class="smallcaps">ot</span>
(operational transformation) without mentioning <span class=
"smallcaps">crdt</span> (conflict-free replicated data types). Broadly
speaking, they are the two approaches to collaborative editing.
<span class="smallcaps">ot</span> is the first to be conceived and
researched on since the <span class="oldstyle-num">90</span>’s.
<span class="smallcaps">crdt</span> is a database/distributed system
concept that was brought into collaborative editing in around
<span class="oldstyle-num">2006</span>. I’ll briefly introduce both and
give them a comparison, before delving into <span class=
"smallcaps">ot</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">ot</span> works by transforming operations
like insert, delete, update, etc. Consider this example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Two users A, B work on a document containing only “x”;</li>
<li>A inserts “a” before “x” (insert “a” at position 0), propagates its
operation to B;</li>
<li>Not yet aware of A’s modification, B deletes “x” (delete at position
0), propagates its operation to A.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now if A applies B’s operation verbatim, it would delete the character
at position 0, which is “a” rather than the intended “x”. The correct way
is to transform B’s deletion so that it deletes at position 1, which
deletes “x”.</p>
<p>This is a trivial example, but things get very complicated very fast
once you mix more concurrent operations and have <span class=
"oldstyle-num">3+</span> users.</p>
<p>The problem, in essence, is that B’s operation is based on document
state “x”, so A can’t apply it verbatim on document “ax”. Once we
transform the operation to be based on document “ax”, the operation can
apply cleanly.</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">crdt</span> is a data type plus a set of
operations, such that operations can be transmitted in different order
and eventually still get the same result, as long as everybody eventually
receives all the operations. Then, you don’t need a central
synchronization, a distributed gossip protocol can ensure that every node
in the system eventually reach the same state. (I omitted some details
for brevity.)</p>
<p>Turns out you can design a <span class="smallcaps">crdt</span> that
represents a document and a set of operations that covers all text
editing operations. You model the document as a series of characters with
unique ids, and have two operations: insert after the character with id
x, and hide character with id x.</p>
<p>Take the same example above. A’s operation is now “insert after the
beginning of the document”, B’s operation is now “hide character with id
1 (which is character x)”. Note that operations are not position-based
anymore. When A applies B’s operation, it first finds the position of
“the character with id 1”, and deletes it.</p>
<p>You’ll notice that it only has “hide” and no “delete”, because
<span class="smallcaps">crdt</span> handles delete as hide. <span class=
"smallcaps">crdt</span> can’t delete a character since other operations
might need that character as an anchor. (The hidden characters are called
tombstones.)</p>
<h2 id="OT%20vs%20CRDT" class="section">OT vs CRDT</h2>
<p>Both <span class="smallcaps">ot</span> and <span class=
"smallcaps">ctdt</span> are viable approaches, with their own
trade-offs.</p>
<p>Collaborative editing is a distributed systems problem, and as
everything else in distributed systems, you can simplify your system by
either centralizing things (so make it less distributed), or you limit
the number of things you can do (limit the functionality). <span class=
"smallcaps">crdt</span> and <span class="smallcaps">ot</span> moves
around these axes of trade-offs.</p>
<p>The advantage of <span class="smallcaps">cdrt</span> is that it’s
relatively simple to make fully distributed. There are many <span class=
"smallcaps">ot</span> algorithms that claims to be distributed, but they
usually have some catch: vector timestamps, requirement of global
synchronization, bad space/time complexity that scales with number of
nodes in the system, no mention of handling join/leave, etc. (Not to say
there are no truly distributed <span class="smallcaps">ot</span>
algorithms, there are.)</p>
<p>People often credit <span class="smallcaps">crdt</span> for being
simpler than <span class="smallcaps">ot</span>, which it is, <em>on
paper</em>. The papers and algorithms only talk about the concept. But if
you are to actually implement it, and do it efficiently, things get
complicated.</p>
<p>Recall that we described an <span class="smallcaps">ctdt</span>
operation as “find the position of the character with id 1”, a lot of
complexity is hidden in the “find”. How do you find the character with id
1? Are you going to scan the whole document every time?</p>
<p>Also, to use <span class="smallcaps">ctdt</span> in the real-world for
an editor, you need to translate “delete character with id 1” into
something an editor can actually apply, namely, delete character at
position <em>x</em>. And once you find the position of the character with
id 1 in the <span class="smallcaps">ctdt</span> data structure, you’ll
need to subtract the hidden characters from that position, because the
editor’s document doesn’t contain those. Same for the reverse direction,
you need to translate an editor operation made by the user into a
<span class="smallcaps">ctdt</span> operation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a basic <span class="smallcaps">ot</span> algorithm
is much easier to implement.</p>
<p>Even though <span class="smallcaps">ot</span> <span class=
"smallcaps">do</span> is simple, <span class="smallcaps">ot</span>
<span class="smallcaps">undo</span> is very complicated and inefficient.
We’ll expand on this later sections. Undo <span class=
"smallcaps">ctdt</span> is simple and can be handled as normal
operations.</p>
<p>I hope I’ve demonstrated that neither <span class=
"smallcaps">ot</span> or <span class="smallcaps">ctdt</span> is strictly
superior to another. Some further comparison can be found in Appendix
A.</p>
<h2 id="Intro%20to%20OT" class="section">Intro to OT</h2>
<p>An <span class="smallcaps">ot</span> algorithm is made of three parts,
a set of basic operations; the transformation function that transforms
operations against each other; and a control algorithm that determines
which operation to transform against which.</p>

<p>Most of the algorithms mentioned in the history section has
accompanying implementation. Most notably Sun et al implemented CoWord
and CoMaya, which brings collaborative editing to Word and Maya. Very
impressive work. The latest algorithm used in CoWord and CoMaya is
<span class="smallcaps">cot</span>. <span class="smallcaps">cot</span> is
also used in <a href="https://www.codox.io">CodoxWord</a> and
<span class="smallcaps">ibm</span> OpenCoWeb according to the <a id=

<span class="smallcaps">crdt</span> can’t work well with rich

on complicated operations like “add table row”. And all the commercial

But, I’m pretty sure that <span class="smallcaps">ctdt</span> can handle

converting high-level operations in the application into three primitive
operations: insert, delete, update. You just need to properly implement
<span class="smallcaps">ctdt</span> with rich text, rather than encoding
rich text in <span class="smallcaps">json</span>, and use <span class=

<p>Space complexity: <span class="smallcaps">crdt</span> document keeps
all the characters ever inserted, both visible characters and tombstones.
<span class="smallcaps">ot</span> needs to store all the concurrent
operations. It doesn’t need to store <em>all</em> the operations: once an
operation is known to be applied at all nodes, it can be discarded.</p>
<p>So it seems <span class="smallcaps">ot</span> has better space
complexity in general? Not quite. If you want to make the <span class=
"smallcaps">ot</span> system fully distributed, you’ll have to keep all
the history, since it’s impossible to tell if an operation is applied at
every node when you don’t even know all the nodes. And if you think about
it, “full history” and “all characters even inserted in to the document”

operation, you can garbage-collection tombstones in <span class=

<p>Time complexity: readers are advised to read other materials.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a <a id="footref:real-difference" class=
"footref-anchor obviously-a-link" aria-label="Jump to footnote" href=
"#footdef%3Areal-difference">detailed paper<sup class=
"inline-footref">10</sup></a> that compares <span class=
"smallcaps">ot</span> and <span class="smallcaps">crdt</span>. It was
later expanded into a three-part series: <a id=

The main idea is that <span class="smallcaps">ctdt</span> in its essence
is still based on transformations, and there are a lot of hidden
complications applying the algorithm on paper to editors. The paper makes
<span class="smallcaps">ctdt</span> sound like being inferior to
<span class="smallcaps">ot</span>,</p>

<span class="smallcaps">got</span> aims to solve the deOPT puzzle. Then
there is <span class="smallcaps">goto</span> also in <span class=

"#footdef%3AANYUNDO"><span class="smallcaps">anyundo</span><sup class=

that can undo any operation at any time. Previous algorithms usually have
some restriction on what operation can be undone and when can you undo
it. <span class="smallcaps">anyundo</span> only concerns with undo so it
pairs with <span class="smallcaps">goto</span> to become a complete
solution.</p>

theoretical paper in <span class="oldstyle-num">2016</span>. (They also
proposed a improved version of <span class="smallcaps">tibot</span>,
<span class="smallcaps">tibot 2.0</span>, in that paper.)</p>
<p>Control algorithm wise, it seems to end there for Sun et al. After
<span class="smallcaps">cot</span>, they went on to research collab
editing for 3D modeling software (eg, Co-Maya).</p>
<p><a id="footref:TIBOT" class="footref-anchor obviously-a-link"

algorithm that uses logic time intervals, doesn’t need central ordering
and doesn’t need vector timestamp. (Still, every node needs to constantly
sync with every other node, so join/leave will be a challenge.)</p>
<p>There are some other algorithms proposed by other researchers:
<span class="smallcaps">soct3/4</span>, <span class=
"smallcaps">nice</span>, etc. You can check out the <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation">wiki page on
operational transformation</a>. It has a nice table summarizing a lot of
the algorithms.</p>
<p>Post <span class="smallcaps">cot</span>, the trend seems to have
shifted to two major directions: One is <a id="footref:ttf" class=
"footref-anchor obviously-a-link" aria-label="Jump to footnote" href=
"#footdef%3Attf"><span class="smallcaps">ttf</span><sup class=
"inline-footref">23</sup></a> (by <a href=
"%E2%97%8Asc%7Bhal%7D"><span class="smallcaps">hal</span></a>), which
incorporates tomstones into <span class="smallcaps">ot</span> to improve
undo complexity. Another is <a id="footref:abt" class=
"footref-anchor obviously-a-link" aria-label="Jump to footnote" href=
"#footdef%3Aabt"><span class="smallcaps">abt</span><sup class=
"inline-footref">24</sup></a> (by Li & Li), which moves operations in the
history buffer such that operation that inserts a character always come
before operation that deletes that character.</p>
<p>Along the <span class="smallcaps">ttf</span> line, you have <a id=
"footref:UNO" class="footref-anchor obviously-a-link" aria-label=
"Jump to footnote" href="#footdef%3AUNO"><span class=
"smallcaps">uno</span><sup class="inline-footref">25</sup></a>, <a id=
"footref:ST-Undo" class="footref-anchor obviously-a-link" aria-label=
"Jump to footnote" href="#footdef%3AST-Undo">ST-Undo<sup class=
"inline-footref">26</sup></a>, etc. Along the <span class=
"smallcaps">abt</span> line, you have <a id="footref:ABTU" class=
"footref-anchor obviously-a-link" aria-label="Jump to footnote" href=
"#footdef%3AABTU"><span class="smallcaps">abtu</span><sup class=
"inline-footref">27</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Here I quote the author of ST-Undo:</p>
<blockquote>The follow-up OT-based undo solutions invent functional
components to address the abnormal ordering problem. TTF [36] introduces
an object sequence to keep deleted objects. ABT [39] introduces a special
history buffer in which insert operations are placed before delete
operations. UNO [25, 26] is a selective undo algorithm built on TTF. As
deleted objects are never lost, UNO can preserve the ordering relations
among objects. Except for the object sequence, UNO stores both do and
undo operation in the history buffer. The time and space complexity of
UNO is linear in the size of the object sequence plus the number of
operations in the history buffer. ABTU [28] is developed from ABT [39].
In ABTU, undo operations are stored in the form of inverse operations of
the corresponding do operations in the history buffer. As an operation
may be transformed with both do and undo operations, ABTU arranges the
operations in the history buffer according to their effect positions.
ABTU has a linear time and space complexity in the size of history
buffer.</blockquote>
<p>I only looked into ST-Undo and <span class="smallcaps">abtu</span>
closely. <span class="smallcaps">abtu</span> is very complicated and uses
vector timestamps, ST-Undo is moderately complicated, but I think part of
the complexity (using a tree to store tomstones) is unnecessary.</p>
<p>I also found <a id="footref:OPTIC" class=
"footref-anchor obviously-a-link" aria-label="Jump to footnote" href=
"#footdef%3AOPTIC"><span class="smallcaps">optic</span><sup class=
"inline-footref">28</sup></a>, seems like a “truly distributed” algorithm
that handles node joining and leaving.</p>
