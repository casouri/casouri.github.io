<p>Tldr: set <code>word-wrap-by-category</code> to <code>t</code>.</p>
<p>Here is a piece of text mixed with CJK and Latin scripts, word-wrapped
by Emacs. You will notice something strange: Emacs breaks off the newline
right after the word “word-wrap” (marked by the cursor). That is way too
early. Instead, it should have broken off the new line like shown in the
second screenshot. The difference between the to screenshot is that I set
<code>word-wrap-by-category</code>, a new variable in Emacs 28, to
<code>t</code> in the second screenshot. (Of course, both screenshot have
<code>visual-line-mode</code> on, otherwise Emacs doesn’t word-wrap.)</p>

<p>Before Emacs 28, Emacs word-wraps by simply looking for space
characters. In out text, the only space character is the one after
“word-wrap”, so Emacs breaks the line there. In Emacs 28, if
<code>word-wrap-by-category</code> is non-nil, Emacs knows it can break
line after CJK characters.</p>
<p>That’s not all, in CJK languages, certain punctuation are not to be at
the end of a line, and some are not to be at the start. Opening
punctuation marks like <span class="full-width-mark">（</span><span class=
"squeeze full-width-mark">“</span><span class=
"squeeze full-width-mark">《</span> shouldn't be left at the end of a
line, closing marks like <span class=
"squeeze full-width-mark">》</span><span class=
"squeeze full-width-mark">”</span><span class="full-width-mark">）</span>
shouldn’t be at the start. Someone call these widow/orphans glyph.</p>
<p>When <code>word-wrap-by-category</code> is non-nil, Emacs is also
smart enough to avoid these widow and orphan glyph.</p>
<figure><img src="./orphan.png" alt=
"A piece of text that avoids an orphan glyph">
<figcaption>Emacs avoided the orphan glyph by moving the <span class=
"full-width-mark">《</span> mark to the next line</figcaption>

<h2 id="Custom%20window%20layout%20in%20GDB" class="section">Custom
window layout in GDB</h2>
<p>Emacs provides a multi-window UI for interacting with GDB: set
<code>gdb-many-windows</code> to <code>t</code> and type <code>M-x gdb
RET</code>. The layout of that multi-window interface is fixed before
Emacs 28: there is no way of telling Emacs to remember moving the
register window to the left every time you open GDB. In Emacs 28, there
is now <code>gdb-save-window-configuration</code>, which saves the
current window layout (window configuration) of the GDB interface to a
file, and <code>gdb-load-window-configuration</code>, which loads the
window layout.</p>
<p>Here is how to use them: open GDB, move windows around as you like,
and call <code>gdb-save-window-configuration</code> to save it to a file.
Next, set <code>gdb-default-window-configuration-file</code> to your
file. Now every time you open GDB, your custom window layout is used.</p>
