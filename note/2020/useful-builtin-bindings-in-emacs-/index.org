Commands

| ~list-character-sets~                | Shows all unicode character sets. |
| ~display-fill-column-indicator-mode~ | Shows a line at 80 column.        |

[fn:1] Hit =M-r= to start the search. Then hit =C-s= for next match (instead of =M-r=). I don’t know this at first and couldn’t understand why =M-r= doesn’t work.
[fn:2] Or =M-x count-words=, which is easier to remember.
