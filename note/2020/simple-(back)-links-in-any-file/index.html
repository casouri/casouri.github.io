This is the first post of my new blog series “site-lisp packages” where I introduce some packages in my <code>site-lisp</code> directory. Currently, I’ve collected 20+ packages, surely someone will find some of them helpful.
</p>

<p>
Recently I started to use <a href="https://jblevins.org/projects/deft/">Deft</a> as a replacement for Apple’s Notes.app to take some technical notes. Meanwhile, Zettelkasten and org-roam has caught my eye. These links and back-links are certainly useful for organizing my notes. 
</p>

<p>
Some good person has already written a package, <a href="https://www.eliasstorms.net/zetteldeft/zetteldeft.html#install">zetteldeft</a>, that combines deft and back-links. However, I don’t really like his use of ids. Why don’t we just use filenames to identify a file? And back-links doesn’t need a database like org-roam does, for my simple use-cases, I can just use <code>grep</code>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org4b68384" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="Introducing-bklink.el">Introducing bklink.el</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-Introducing-bklink.el">
<p>
bklink.el is my cheap version of org-roam that only provides two features:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>make links to other files.</li>
<li>show back-links from other files.</li>
</ol>
<p>
It works in any text file format, and uses filenames as links, no ids or databases. However, it only works in these situations:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>All the files are in the same directory, no sub-directories.</li>
<li>There aren’t a huge number of files.</li>
</ol>
<p>
These assumptions make the implementation simpler, and suits my notes well.
</p>

<p>
Specifically, bklink.el provides three functions:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><code>bklink-insert</code> inserts a link to another file in the directory.</li>
<li><code>bklink-show-back-link</code> shows a small buffer below the current buffer, containing back-links for this file.</li>
<li><code>bklink-rename</code> to rename all links that points to this file.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The links inserted looks like <code>“file name”</code>, while the actual text is <code>[{file name.ext}]</code>.
</p>

<p>
One thing I think I did right is the back-link buffer: it automatically follows the main buffer as you move/hide/switch to the main buffer. So I never need to manually close or move the buffer. The back-link buffer in org-roam annoys me a little, so I paid attention to get it right in bklink.el.
</p>

<p>
Here is a demo of bklink.el:

<h2 id="Implementation-details">Implementation details</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-Implementation-details">
<p>
Because I made some assumptions on my notes, I can simplify the implementation:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>All the files are in the same directory, no sub-directories. So I can just use base filename as unique identifiers. This also means I can work in different directories in the same time without any conflict.</li>
<li>We don’t have a huge number of files, so an async grep should be fast enough to get the back links. In fact, even if there are too many files for grep to handle, I have a backup plan that adds cache files, so I’m not too worried about the future.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The links are formatted as <code>[{filename.ext}]</code>, and displayed as <code>“filename”</code>. This format has several advantages:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It doesn’t conflict with Org Mode’s link format. Although most of my notes are in plain text format, I do have some Org files in my notes.</li>
<li>I don’t hide the delimiters, but render them as quotes. In my experience, hiding delimiters makes editing the text more difficult (think about links in Org Mode).</li>
</ol>

<p>
In fact, I didn’t start with this format. I started with one that’s similar to zetteldeft’s, and changed it several times:
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>
The good thing about writing your own package is that not only can you write it to fit your specific need (like the assumptions I made on my notes), but also can you change the design anytime. (This is also why I don’t publish these small packages, I don’t want to be responsible for a stable user experience.)
</p>

<p>
Apart from the “sticky” back-link buffer (read more about it in <a href="../atomic-buffer/index.html">Atomic Buffer</a>), there aren’t much to talk about. Getting back-links is just calling grep in a sub-process and installing a sentinel that parses the stdout and inserts back-links into the back-link buffer. I also added highlight for URL links, so I can click on URL’s in my note.
</p>

<p>
The funny thing about renaming is that, there is no UNIX command that can search &amp; replace text literally in one line, not even 10 lines. So I ended up grepping files and replace with Emacs—I grep for a list of files that contains the link, writes them to a temporary file, start an Emacs process in batch mode, load bklink.el, load the temporary file, and call a replace function I defined in bklink.el on each file.
