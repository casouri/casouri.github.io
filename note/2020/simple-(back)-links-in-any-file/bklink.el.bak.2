;;; bklink.el --- Poor man's back-link      -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: Yuan Fu <casouri@gmail.com>

;;; This file is NOT part of GNU Emacs

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; In org-roam, you can show back-links -- a list of files that
;; contains a link to the current file. The idea is nice but I don’t
;; like how org-roam and zetteldeft implement things. Hence this
;; minimal package.
;;
;; Some assumptions about the files that contains bklink:
;;
;;  1. All the files are in the same directory. So we can use filename
;;     to uniquely identify files.
;;  2. There is no sub-directories.
;;  3. There aren’t a ton of files. We use grep to search for links,
;;     no caching (though not hard to add one).
;;  4. filenames don’t contain “}]”.
;;
;; Advantages:
;;
;;  1. Filename as link, no id, no database.
;;  2. Works for multiple directories without configuration.
;;  3. Works for any file format.
;;  4. Back-link buffer follows the main buffer automatically.
;;
;; To use with Deft:
;;
;;     (add-hook 'deft-open-file-hook #'bklink-minor-mode)
;;     (setq deft-use-filter-string-for-filename t)
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; Link format is [{filename.ext}]. Extension is optional.
;; Links are displayed as “filename” with 'link face.
;;
;; Insert a link to another file:
;;
;;     M-x bklink-insert RET
;;
;; Show back-links:
;;
;;     M-x bklink-show-back-link RET
;;
;; Rename all links to the current file:
;;
;;     M-x bklink-rename new-name RET
;;
;; And then manually rename the current file.
