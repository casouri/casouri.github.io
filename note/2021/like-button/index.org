#+TITLE: Adding a Like Button to My Static Blog
#+DATE: <2021-01-09 Sat>
#+TAGS: Web

Many times when I read other’s blogs, I wish I can “like” their post to express my appreciation. Of course, most posts don’t, and the ones that do often requires login for liking the post. Since I also want to know if anyone likes my post (or rather “is anyone reading my post?”), I decide to add like buttons to my post, ones that don’t require login.


The idea is simple, when generating the web page, insert a button that when clicked, POST to my server. This button makes a POST request to =/like= with =PATH= = =/note/2021/disappearing-image/index.html=:

#+begin_src html
<form action="/like" method="post">
  <input type="text" name="path" hidden=""
         value="/note/2021/disappearing-image/index.html">
  <button class="like" type="submit">❤ Like</button>
</form>
#+end_src


In my server, I record this like to my database, and I can query how many likes I received:

#+begin_src
sqlite3 database.sqlite3 -box "select uri, count(*) as c \
from like \
group by uri order by c;"
┌─────────────────────────────┬───┐
│             uri             │ c │
├─────────────────────────────┼───┤
│ /rock/day/day-56/index.html │ 3 │
└─────────────────────────────┴───┘
#+end_src

For the confirmation screen, I had a few options:

#+CAPTION: Helvetica Neue Ultra Condensed
[[./design1.png]]

#+CAPTION: Helvetica Neue Ultra Condensed, white on black
[[./design2.png]]

#+CAPTION: Mechanically condensed Helvetica, white on black
[[./design3.png]]

#+CAPTION: Helvetica Ultra Condensed, white on pink
[[./design4.png]]

I want to give the reader a surprise, so I inverted the background to increase contrast. Then I thought about using mechanically condensed font instead of normal condense to further increase contrast and tension. Comparing figure 2 and 3, you can clearly feel the unnaturalness and discomfort of mechanically condensed fonts. No wonder EVA uses it. But then I thought I just want to surprise the reader, but not making them uncomfortable, so I didn’t use figure 3 in the end.

But hey, like should be positive and warm and happy, what’s with the solemn black & white? My blog is already kinda boring with so less color. So I ended up changing the background to a warm pink.
