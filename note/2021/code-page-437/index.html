<p>So I was installing a new OS on my desktop machine, and for some
technical reasons I need to install the OS manually. That means typing in
a console. I couldn’t help but wonder: what the font is it showing?</p>

<figcaption>I was typing in this</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Turns out the typeface isn’t even a typeface. It is a encoding that
extends ASCII. It maps 8-bit patterns to characters. For
example,<code>10000110</code> corresponds to “å”. According to Wikipedia,
It is the“standard character set of the original IBM PC”, and it “remains
the primary set in the core of any EGA and VGA-compatible graphic cards”.
Basically this is the most basic font on a personal computer, stored
directly in hardware.</p>
<p>This character set is supposed to contain many characters including
fancy ones like “⌠”, “☺”, “§”, etc. But my graphic card is missing most
of the non-basic characters. (How disappointing!)</p>

<p>I don’t think this font is pretty or anything. What makes it so
interesting to me is that it is such ubiquitous yet most people never
notice it. Next time <a id="footref:PC" class=
"footref-anchor obviously-a-link" aria-label="Jump to footnote" href=
"#footdef%3APC">when your PC starts up or crashes<sup class=
"inline-footref">1</sup></a>, see if you can spot any message printed in
this font.</p>
<p>You can even download the font file for this font: <a href=
"https://cp437.github.io"><em>Code Page 437</em></a>.</p>
<p>PS. this makes me wonder if Mac has something similar, and sure
enough, there is. <a href=
"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/157038/what-font-is-used-during-verbose-boot-mode">
Someone asked about it on StackExchange</a>. I bet even less people know
about this one. I for one have never seen it despite using a MacBook for
years (That’s probably a good thing, as one only see it when something
goes hopelessly wrong.)</p>
<p>PPS. On Linux, you can drop yourself into a console by typing
Ctrl+Alt+F1/F2/etc. Usually that screen is printed in <a href=
"http://terminus-font.sourceforge.net">Terminus</a>.</p>
