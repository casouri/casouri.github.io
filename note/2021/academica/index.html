<p><a href="https://www.stormtype.com/families/academica">Academica</a>
is a typeface I found out when reading <a href=
"https://aeon.co"><em>aeon</em></a> (a digital magazine in Science and
Humanities). Academica is designed by Josef Týfa for scientific texts.
The original design was cut and cast in metal in 1968, and in 2003, Týfa
and František Štorm worked together to rework it for digital
printing.</p>
<p>Academica shares some similarities with Charter in tall x‑height and
emphasize on legibility, but the similarity pretty much ends there.
Comparing to Charter, Academica is considerably blacker. And comparing to
Charter’s <a id="footref:stoic" class="footref-anchor obviously-a-link"
aria-label="Jump to footnote" href="#footdef%3Astoic">stoic stint on
curves<span class="inline-footref">1</span></a>, Academica is lavishly
rounded, tapered, bent, squished and stretched. In fact, I don’t even
know why am I comparing it to Charter, Academica reminds me more of
another typeface (that I dig), <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Black">Cooper Black</a>.</p>

<p>The alien-looking 0 is perhaps the most salient character (pun
intended) in Academica. Instead of simply narrowing 0 to distinguish it
from capital O, Academica “flipped” it such that the horizontal stroke is
thicker than the vertical. The 0 is really the culmination of the overall
vibe of Academica—little roundish goofiness here and there, slightly
throwing the reader off; but when you zoom away, you see a legible,
realistic academic typeface.</p>

<p>Overall, Academica feels humane to me. It is a practical typeface for
serious scientific publications, but in the same time has its very own
quirky character. I’m very fond of it. Better, it isn’t very expensive
either, unlike some modern digital fonts. If you buy it on <a href=
"https://www.myfonts.com">myfonts.com</a>, each font costs $44 (at the
time of writing). <a id="footref:need" class=
"footref-anchor obviously-a-link" aria-label="Jump to footnote" href=
"#footdef%3Aneed">Regular, italic and bold<span class=
"inline-footref">2</span></a> combined costs $132. That’s more than a cup
of coffee, but still.</p>

<div class="def-footdef">Of course, there is nothing bad about stoic
outlines. Matthew Carter designed Charter for low-resolution laser
printers (which will muddle any delicate detail on the character), and
aimed for economic use of curves to accommodate low-memory computers and
printers. More over, the crisp, direct, clean outline is actually one of
Charter’s virtues.</div>

<div class="def-footref obviously-a-link"><a aria-label=
"Jump back to main text" href="#footref%3Aneed">2</a></div>
<div class="def-footdef">Regular, italic and bold is really all you need.
And if you want to use Academica in larger size (larger than ~12pt), then
Light, Light italic and Regular is probably a better choice.</div>
