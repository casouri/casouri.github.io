<p><a href="https://www.stormtype.com/families/academica">Academica</a>
is a typeface I found out when reading <a href=
"https://aeon.co"><em>aeon</em></a> (a digital magazine in Science and
Humanities). Academica is designed by Josef Týfa for scientific texts.
The original design was cut and cast in metal in 1968, and in 2003, Týfa
and František Štorm worked together to rework it for digital
printing.</p>
<p>Academica shares some similarities with Charter in tall x‑height and
emphasize on legibility, but the similarity pretty much ends there.
Comparing to Charter, Academica is considerably blacker. And comparing to
Charter’s <a id="footref:stoic" class="footref-anchor obviously-a-link"
aria-label="Jump to footnote" href="#footdef%3Astoic">stoic stint on
curves<sup class="inline-footref">1</sup></a>, Academica is lavishly
rounded, tapered, bent, squished and stretched. In fact, I don’t even
know why am I comparing it to Charter, Academica reminds me more of
another typeface (that I dig), <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Black">Cooper Black</a>.</p>

<p>The alien-looking 0 is perhaps the most salient character (pun
intended) in Academica. Instead of simply narrowing 0 to distinguish it
from capital O, Academica “flipped” it such that the horizontal stroke is
thicker than the vertical. The 0 is really the culmination of the overall
vibe of Academica—little roundish goofiness here and there, slightly
throwing the reader off; but when you zoom away, you see a legible,
realistic academic typeface.</p>

<p>I love the color of Academica, it’s thiccc ;-) Use it for body text,
and the dense, full color is beautiful. Looking at a block of Academica,
you can almost feel the energy of live imbued in every corner. Also, the
tall x-height means you can pack more lines into a page, increasing the
information density.</p>
<p>Overall, Academica feels humane to me. It is a practical typeface for
serious scientific publications, but in the same time has its very own
quirky character. I’m very fond of it. It isn’t that expensive either. If
you buy it on <a href="https://www.myfonts.com">myfonts.com</a>, each
font costs $44 (at the time of writing). <a id="footref:need" class=
"footref-anchor obviously-a-link" aria-label="Jump to footnote" href=
"#footdef%3Aneed">So regular, italic and bold<sup class=
"inline-footref">2</sup></a> combined costs $132. That’s more than a cup
of coffee, but still less than 20 cups (I think?)</p>

<div class="def-footdef">Of course, there is nothing bad about stoic
outlines. Matthew Carter designed Charter for low-resolution laser
printers (which will muddle any delicate detail on the character), and
aimed for economic use of curves to accommodate low-memory computers and
printers. More over, the crisp, direct, clean outline is actually one of
Charter’s virtues. (Edit: Actually, economic use of curves turns out to
be a premature optimization.)</div>

<div class="def-footdef">Regular, italic and bold are really all you
need, sometimes you don’t even need bold. If you want to use Academica in
a larger size (larger than 13pt), then Light, Light italic and Regular is
also a good combination.</div>
