<p>A year has passed since the release of Emacs <span class=
"oldstyle-num">29</span>; last time we added support for tree-sitter and
several tree-sitter-based major modes. This time, there are more major
modes, better support for multi-language modes, and more utility
features.</p>
<p>The first three sections introduce changes visible to end-users, the
rest are for package and major mode developers.</p>
<h2 id="Derived%20mode%20check" class="section">Derived mode check</h2>
<p>Now <code>(derived-mode-p 'c-mode)</code> returns <code>t</code> even
in <code>c-ts-mode</code> (and similarly for other builtin tree-sitter
modes). That means <code>.dir-locals.el</code> settings and yasnippets
for <code>c-mode</code> will work for <code>c-ts-mode</code> too.
However, <code>c-ts-mode</code> still doesn’t run <code>c-mode</code>’s
major mode hooks. Also, there’s still no major mode fallback. But I think
that can be solved by packages like <a href=
"https://github.com/renzmann/treesit-auto">treesit-auto</a>.</p>
<p>This new inheritance doesn’t come automatically, someone needs to use
<code>derived-mode-add-parents</code> to add the relationship.</p>
<h2 id="New%20major%20modes" class="section">New major modes</h2>
<p>There are some new built-in major modes: Elixir and <span class=
"smallcaps">hee</span>x mode, <span class="smallcaps">html</span> mode,
Lua mode, <span class="smallcaps">php</span> mode with <span class=
"smallcaps">phpd</span>oc support, and Doxygen support for C/C++/Java
mode. Kudos to Wilhelm for writing Elixir and <span class=
"smallcaps">hee</span>x mode, John for writing Lua mode, and Vincenzo for
writing <span class="smallcaps">php</span> mode and Doxygen support!</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">hee</span>x mode and <span class=
"smallcaps">php</span> mode really shows the power of tree-sitter:
without tree-sitter, it would take a lot of work to write a major mode
for mixed languages like these; now tree-sitter takes care of all the
hard work, and we can focus on writing the things we care about:
font-lock and indentation rules, utility commands, etc.</p>
<p>When Wilhelm and Vincenzo were implementing multi-language major
modes, they found bugs and missing features in Emacs and provided
invaluable feedback on emacs-devel and the bug tracker. Their feedback
and requests allow us to improve Emacs’ support for multi-languages. So
if you’re writing a major mode or some package with tree-sitter and run
into issues, don’t hesitate to reach out on emacs-devel or the bug
tracker!</p>
<h2 id="Sexp%20movement" class="section">Sexp movement</h2>
<p>I’ll explain it a bit more in the next section, but the gist is that
<code>forward-sexp</code> and <code>backward-sexp</code> can now use the
parse tree for navigation, as long as the major mode adds support for
them. Users can also change what’s considered a <code>sexp</code> (A
statement? An expression? Or any node in the parse tree?) themselves,
overriding the major mode’s setting.</p>
<h2 id="Defining%20things" class="section">Defining things</h2>
<p>Sections below are mostly for developers.</p>
<p>In the spirt of <code>thing-at-point</code>, a major mode or user can
now define tree-sitter <em>things</em>: <code>defun</code>,
<code>sexp</code>, <code>sentence</code>, <code>comment</code>,
<code>text</code>, <code>block</code>, etc. The definition is flexible:
it can be a regexp matching node names, or a predicate function, or a
regexp plus a predicate. It can also be defined with logical operands
<code>not</code> and <code>or</code>, like <code>(not sexp)</code>, or
<code>(not "comment")</code>, <code>(or comment text)</code>.</p>
<p>At the moment, the following “standard” things are used by Emacs:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sexp</code>: Used by <code>forward-sexp</code>, etc.</li>
<li><code>defun</code>: Used by <code>end-of-defun</code>, etc.</li>
<li><code>sentence</code>: Used by <code>forward-sentence</code>. In
imperative languages, it can be a statement.</li>
<li><code>comment</code>: All types of comments.</li>
<li><code>string</code>: All types of strings.</li>
<li><code>text</code>: Any non-code. Comments, strings, and text in
languages <span class="smallcaps">html</span> and jsx.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like font-lock features, we’re starting with a basic list; if you have
suggestions fore more things (perhaps you wrote a package that uses a
thing that major modes should support), reach out on emacs-devel or
debbugs.</p>
<p>Tree-sitter things are supported in every tree-sitter function . Once
the major mode defines it, everyone can use it. Here are some things you
can do with it:</p>
<p>Get the sexp at point <a id="footref:in-any-mode" class=
"footref-anchor obviously-a-link" aria-label="Jump to footnote" href=
"#footdef%3Ain-any-mode">in any tree-sitter major mode<sup class=
"inline-footref">1</sup></a>: <code>(treesit-thing-at-point
'sexp)</code>. Get the sexp before point: <code>(treesit-thing-prev
(point) 'sexp)</code>.</p>
<div id="footdef:in-any-mode" class="footdef">
<div class="def-footref obviously-a-link"><a aria-label=
"Jump back to main text" href="#footref%3Ain-any-mode">1</a></div>
<div class="def-footdef">Provided that the mode defined the thing.</div>
</div>
<p>Generate a tree of all the defuns in a buffer:</p>
<pre class="code-block">(treesit-induce-sparse-tree
 (treesit-buffer-root-node)
 'defun)</pre>
<p>Traverse things:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>treesit-beginning-of-thing</code></li>
<li><code>treesit-end-of-thing</code></li>
<li><code>treesit-navigate-things</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I can also see packages reserving a particular thing, and have major
modes add definition for that thing. In that case, it’s best to add the
package prefix to avoid naming conflict.</p>
<h2 id="Local%20parsers" class="section">Local parsers</h2>
<p>Normally, even for the embedded language, there’s only one parser for
that language in a buffer. Each individual embedded code block are
“stitched together” and is parsed as a whole by that parser. The pro is
we only need to create one parser, the cons are error in one code block
might affect other code blocks, and sometimes, each code block is
syntactically self-contained and shouldn’t be stitched with others.</p>
<p>That’s why we added local parsers, with each one confined to a single
code block. Emacs creates and manages parsers for each embedded code
block automatically. <span class="smallcaps">phpd</span>oc and Doxygen
support are possible thanks to local parsers. To use local parsers,
simply add the <code>:local t</code> flag in
<code>treesit-range-rules</code>, and Emacs handles the rest.</p>
<h2 id="Other%20changes" class="section">Other changes</h2>
<p>A small convenience improvement: <code>treesit-font-lock-rules</code>
now supports the <code>:default-language</code> keyword, so major mode
author don’t need to write <code>:language 'xxx</code> for every query
anymore.</p>
<p>Each parser in the parser list now has a tag. By default, a parser has
the <code>nil</code> tag, and <code>(treesit-parser-list)</code> returns
all the parsers with <code>nil</code> tag (because the third optional
argument <code>TAG</code> defaults to <code>nil</code>). That means if
you don’t explicitly set a tag when creating a parser, it’ll show up when
anyone calls <code>(treesit-parser-list)</code>. On the other hand, you
can create a parser that doesn’t show up in the parser list if you give
it a non-nil tag. The intended use-case is to create special purpose
parsers that shouldn’t normally appear in the parser list.</p>
<p>Local parsers has the <code>embedded</code> tag, so they don’t appear
in the parser list. You can get them by passing <code>embedded</code> to
the <code>TAG</code> argument, or by passing the special value
<code>t</code> to the <code>TAG</code> argument, which means return all
parsers regardless of their tag.</p>
<p>There’s a new variable <code>treesit-language-remap-alist</code>. If a
language A is mapped to another language B in this alist. Creating a
parser of A actually uses the grammar of B. If someone wants to write a
major mode for tree-sitter-cuda, which extends upon tree-sitter-cpp, they
can map <code>cpp</code> to <code>cuda</code>, so the font-lock rules and
indentation rules defined in <code>c++-ts-mode</code> can be borrowed to
cuda mode verbatim.</p>
<p>Indirect buffers now gets individual parser lists. In Emacs 29, the
origin buffer and all its indirect buffers share the same parser list.
Now they each have their own parser list.</p>
<h2 id="Better%20filling%20for%20C-style%20comment%20blocks" class=
"section">Better filling for C-style comment blocks</h2>
<p>This is not directly related to tree-sitter but it affects tree-sitter
modes for all C-like languages. You see, all these tree-sitter major
modes (C, C++, Java, Rust, Javascript, Typescript) uses C-style comment
blocks, and they all use <code>c-ts-common.el</code> for things like
filling the comment block, or setting up <code>comment-start</code>,
etc.</p>
<p>Traditionally these kind of major modes use cc-mode’s utilities, but
cc-mode is a beast on its own, and it’s not worth it to add that
dependency for filling a comment block. (It’s not just code dependency,
but also cc-mode’s own parsering facility, data structure, etc.) So we
had to recreate these utilities in <code>c-ts-common.el</code>, with the
bonus goal of keeping the code as easy to read as possible.</p>
<p>Filling C-style comment block is harder than one might imagine. It’s
quite involved and interesting, and worth a separate article on its own.
Suffice to say that the filling logic is improved and works on even more
styles of C comment blocks now. Below are a few among the ones that we
support.</p>
<pre class="code-block">/* xxx  /**    /* xxx
 * xxx   * xxx    xxx
 */      */       xxx */

/*======  /*
 * xxx     | xxx
 *======/  */</pre>
<p>And it goes beyond just filling, when you type return in a comment
block, you expect the next line to be prefixed with some character
(<code>*</code> or <code>|</code> or space) and indented to the right
place. Making that work for all those styles on top of the filling and
keeping the code reasonably readable is a small miracle :-)</p>
<h2 id="Primary%20parser" class="section">Primary parser</h2>
<p>If you are the author of a tree-sitter major mode, make sure to set
<code>treesit-primary-parser</code> in your major mode if it has multiple
languages! This is a new variable added in Emacs <span class=
"oldstyle-num">30</span>, and setting it is vital for font-lock update to
work properly in complex situations. Emacs makes a reasonable guess when
the major mode doesn’t set it themselves (it sets the first parser in the
parser list as the primary parser). But this guess doesn’t work reliably
for multi-language major modes.</p>
<p>Besides Emacs itself, other packages can also make use of this
variable. It’ll be better than <code>(car (treesit-parser-list))</code>,
especially in multi-language modes.</p>
<p>Having an explicit primary parser allows Emacs to update the “changed
region” after each buffer change correctly, especially for multi-language
modes. For example, when the user types the closing block comment
delimiter <code>*/</code>, not only does Emacs fontify the
<code>*/</code> itself, it also needs to re-fontify the whole block
comment, which previously weren’t fontified in comment face due to
incomplete parse tree. You can read more about it in
<code>treesit--font-lock-mark-ranges-to-fontify</code> and
<code>treesit--pre-redisplay</code>.</p>
<h2 id="Ready%20your%20major%20mode%20for%20Emacs%2030" class="section">
Ready your major mode for Emacs 30</h2>
<p>Here’s a check list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define <code>treesit-primary-parser</code>.</li>
<li>Define things in <code>treesit-thing-settings</code>, especially
<code>sexp</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Err, that list is shorter than I thought. But I do have some more
words for <code>sexp</code> thing.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways of defining the <code>sexp</code> thing, you
can define it to any node (excluding some punctuation marks), or
repeatable node (function arguments, list elements, statements, blocks,
defun), or a hand-crafted list of nodes.</p>
<p>Defining <code>sexp</code> as every node (excluding punctuation) could
be a good starting point. For example, this is the definition for
<code>sexp</code> in <code>c-ts-mode</code>:</p>
<pre class=
"code-block">(not ,(rx (or "{" "}" "[" "]" "(" ")" ",")))</pre>
<p>This way, if point is at the beginning of any thing, C-M-f will bring
me to the end of that thing, be it an expression, statement, function,
block, or whatever. I use it all the time and it’s very handy for
selecting code.</p>
<p><a id="footref:sexp-list" class="footref-anchor obviously-a-link"
aria-label="Jump to footnote" href="#footdef%3Asexp-list">A slight
upgrade<sup class="inline-footref">2</sup></a> from this is to define
<code>sexp</code> to anything that’s repeatable. That takes a bit more
effort but C-M-f will always move you to the end of a repeatable
construct. This is more inline with the concept of sexp, where we
consider each repeatable construct in the code as an atom.</p>
<div id="footdef:sexp-list" class="footdef">
<div class="def-footref obviously-a-link"><a aria-label=
"Jump back to main text" href="#footref%3Asexp-list">2</a></div>
<div class="def-footdef">This is just my personal opinion, of course.
“Everything is a sexp” might as well be better, since you can move over
more types of things.</div>
</div>
<h2 id="Emacs%2031" class="section">Emacs 31</h2>
<p>At this point we have pretty good support for writing major modes with
tree-sitter. Many tree-sitter major modes and packages appeared after
Emacs <span class="oldstyle-num">29</span> and it’s very encouraging.
We’ll continue making it easier to write major modes with tree-sitter,
and make it easier to use and configure tree-sitter modes. For example,
we’ll add a baseline indentation rule, so major mode authors need to
write less indentation rules. And there’re some upgrades to the sexp
movement, too.</p>
<p>There are still some unsolved issues. The lack of versioning for
language grammars breaks major modes from time to time; installing
tree-sitter grammar is not very easy; tree-sitter library still has bugs
that results in incorrect parse tree or even causes Emacs to hang. These
will be resolved, albeit slowly.</p>
<p>That’s about it! Emacs has been making good progress regarding
tree-sitter. And as I said last time, tree-sitter is a really good way to
start contributing to Emacs. We’ve seen folks adding their tree-sitter
modes into Emacs, you could be the next! Also, many existing builtin
major modes lacks utiliy functions that usually come with a major mode.
If you see missing feature in a mode, feel free to send a patch!</p>
<p>Ok folks, stay tuned for the next update for Emacs <span class=
"oldstyle-num">31</span>, and feel free to reach out in the meantime!</p>
