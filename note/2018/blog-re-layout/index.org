* Beginning
I found a really interesting and informative online book about typography: [[https://practicaltypography.com][Practical Typography]].
The book talks about how to use symbols, fonts, page layout, and much more.

As professional writers and publishers for our own writing,
it is important for me and you to make typography of our document right[fn:1].
I recommend you to read through it.
The book is short, and the writer made it a fun read.

[fn:1] IMO, “right” means the document is pleasing to read and effective
in displaying messages.

* Middle
** Hyper links
Initially I use underline on hyperlinks,
and in the [[https://practicaltypography.com/underlining.html][underlineing]] chapter of the book,
the author suggests to shift away from underline links.

My first attempt is to go to apple.com and copied what they do with hyperlinks:
no underline except when mouse hovers on it and with blue color.
It has a little problem:
Apple.com is much more colorful than my blog;
using color for links is fine for them, but the blue links stand out a bit
too much for me.

The book itself uses small caps for links. I hated it when reading the book.
Because I'm not a native English speaker,
small caps is hard for me to read and reading them is uncomfortable.
So I'm definitely not using that.

Then I tried bold. However, Baskerville(the font I was using) has a super thick bold.
Bold links stand out even more than blue links and are much harder to read.

Now it seems I need a font with more weight options. I went out and installed
Source Serif Pro, one of the free fonts that the book approves.

Turns out the semi bold didn't work for me, either. But semi light did.

Until this point I'm still undecided between blue and semi light.
For now I uses semi light (as you might see, if I didn't change it).

Here is my configuration on links:
#+BEGIN_SRC css
:link, :visited {
    color: black;
    font-weight: 200;
    text-decoration: none;
}
#+END_SRC

** Font
My font setup:

#+BEGIN_SRC css
@font-face {
    font-family: "Source Serif Pro";
    src: url("./misc/SourceSerifPro-Black.otf");
    font-weight: 900;
}
@font-face {
    font-family: "Source Serif Pro";
    src: url("./misc/SourceSerifPro-BlackIt.otf");
    font-weight: 900;
    font-style: italic;
}

...

#+END_SRC

** Readability

I shortened the line length, increased font size and line spacing.
Now their are fewer information (words) per page but it is much more
readable.

** Headers

I removed the bold type on all headers and shrinked their font size.
I also added more blank above each header.

#+BEGIN_SRC css
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, dt {
    font-family: Courier, Monospace;
    font-weight: normal;
}

h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
    margin-top: 40pt;
}

h1 {
    font-size: 28pt;
    margin-bottom: 40pt;
}

h2 {
    font-size: 17pt;
}

h3 {
    font-size: 16.5pt;
}

h4, h5, h6 {
    font-size: 16pt;
}
#+END_SRC

** Mobile and tablet

I also added support for tablets. Now tablets have noticeable margins like desktop does.
I also added a little bit margin for mobile.

#+BEGIN_SRC css
/* desktop, tablet landscape */
@media screen and (min-width: 1025px) {
    /* floating TOC */
    #table-of-contents  {
        font-size: 14pt;
        bottom: 0;
        position: fixed;
        overflow-y: scroll;
        overflow-x: wrap;
        top: 5%;
        left: 2%;
        width: 20%;
    }
    body {
        margin-left: 30%;
        margin-right: 20%;
        width: 50%;
    }
}

/* tablet, protrait */
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
    body {
        margin-left: 20%;
        margin-right: 10%;
        font-size: 14pt;
    }
}

/* mobile */
@media screen and (max-width: 767px) {
    body {
        font-size: 14pt;
        margin-left: 7%;
        margin-right: 7%;
    }
}
#+END_SRC
