My Calculus professor has a really nice white board writing, his letters and symbols are big and distinctive. Really nice to read overall [fn:1]. If you look at the examples, you will find that they are not necessarily beautiful, but comfortable to read.

After taking his class I try to copy his writing on to paper. It is successful except one issue: when he was writing on the board, he took his time, but sometimes when I need to spill out equations line after line on a class, the quality goes down quickly. I don't really have a solution other than to only write in the fast way when I have to, e.g., when I try to catch up.

Some comparison between “slow and nice” and “fast and raw”:

The rule of thumb that I come up with:
1. make letters big and clear
2. leave a good among of space between everything
3. prefer print over cursive
4. take your time (when possible)

[fn:1] His board writings, notice his elaborate “a”, I don't do that.
