My Calculus professor has a really nice white board writing, his letters and symbols are big and distinctive. Really nice to read overall <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. If you look at the examples, you will find that they are not necessarily beautiful, but comfortable to read.
</p>

<p>
After taking his class I try to copy his writing on to paper. It is successful except one issue: when he was writing on the board, he took his time, but sometimes when I need to spill out equations line after line on a class, the quality goes down quickly. I don't really have a solution other than to only write in the fast way when I have to, e.g., when I try to catch up.
</p>

<p>
Some comparison between “slow and nice” and “fast and raw”:

The rule of thumb that I come up with:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>make letters big and clear</li>
<li>leave a good among of space between everything</li>
<li>prefer print over cursive</li>
<li>take your time (when possible)</li>
</ol>

His board writings, notice his elaborate “a”, I don't do that.
