Nowadays you can choose from a handful of static blog frameworks, like hexo, pelican, etc.
Most of them support Markdown, and you can use Org Mode along with them by exporting Org file
to Markdown file. Some framework even has deeper integration. For example the package ox-hugo
provides a dozen advanced export options and well intergrated hugo and Org Mode options/properties.
</p>

<p>
Using frameworks has some advantages and some disadvantages.
On the one side, you get pretty themes, animation, dynamic(automatic) content generation, automatic publication, etc.
On the other side, your cost is: learn a framework, choose from a limited selection of themes or make your own, etc.
</p>

<p>
For me, I don't need animation or pre-made themes.
my blog contains few duplicated parts that need automation,
and I can just write some quick snippet to handle that.
Publication isn't a problem either because I host my blog in GitHub Pages.
All I need is a trivial alias that commits everything and push them.
</p>

<p>
And the cost of a framework is just Too Much TroubleÂ® for me. I tried pelican and hugo and never liked them.
</p>

<p>
Turns out that, <b>Org Mode already provides me with everything I need.</b>
The html export options in Org Mode helps build my blog with trivial effort.
Plus, when building blog with plain HTML, JavaScript, CSS and Org Mode I have so much more control and flexibility.
CSS is much easier because your are writing it directly to HTML, instead of some fancy tags that you don't know who defined.
The blog your are currently reading from is built without any framework and looks pretty complete to me.
</p>

<p>
Below is how do I build my blog.

5 directories, 12 files
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Each sub directory is a year, and sub directories of that are individual posts.
The  <code>index.org</code> and (exported) <code>index.html</code> are the actual content.
Other static contents of a page like images are under the same directory.
Whenever I update an Org file, I re-export it by <code>C-c C-e h h</code>. Then commit both files.
(I could have write a org publish pipeline but too lazy to do so, Magit is just too easy to use.)
</p>

<p>
Under the root directory (<code>/note/</code>), I have a style sheet, a index.org and a index.html in root directory.
<code>index.org</code> and (exported) <code>index.html</code> is my home page. Every page under <code>/note/</code> links to <code>style.css</code>.
</p>

<h2 id="orge0e1336"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> CSS</h2>

<div id="outline-container-orgaba75c8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgaba75c8"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Including Custom Style Sheet</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
Including style sheet(s) is quite easy.
In each Org file that you want to link the style sheet, insert <code>#+HTML_HEAD:</code> or <code>#+HTML_HEAD_EXTRA:</code>.
</p>

<p>
Here is what I have in my Org file:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org-mode">#+HTML_HEAD: &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/note/style.css"/&gt;
#+HTML_HEAD_EXTRA: &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="/note/script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The first line includes the global style sheet I use for pages across my whole personal web site.
The second line includes the scripting file which I will talk about later.
</p>

<p>
Inside my local <code>/note/style.css</code> I have this snippet to import my global style sheet:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-CSS">@import url("/style.css");
</pre>
</div>

<p>
For all the classes Org Mode uses when exporting to HTML, you can find them .
However, that isn't the ultra complete list, the best way is probably look at the exported HTML file.
</p>

<p>
You can open the exported html file in your favorite browser and play with CSS by developer tool.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org16b081f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org16b081f"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Disable Default Styling</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
To turn off the default CSS styling, insert <code>#+OPTIONS: html-style:nil</code>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd3a311a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd3a311a"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> Floating TOC by CSS</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
Put this into your custom css file and you can get a floating TOC on the right of the screen.
I use so TOC only floats on desktop.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-CSS">@media screen and (min-width: 800px) {
    #table-of-contents  {
        position: fixed;
        top: 5%;
        right: 2%;
    }    
}
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org582c14d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org582c14d"><span class="section-number-3">2.4</span> Image Size</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
Because I use a MacBook, my screen shots and photos are usually enormous.
It is great viewing them locally, but not so great when I put them on to the Web.
</p>

<p>
To fix those ridiculously large images, I set this rule in my CSS:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-CSS">img {
    max-width: 400px;
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
and assign custom size with <code>#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100px</code> for individual images.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga1930d1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga1930d1"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Add UP and HOME link</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
If you add these options,
the exported HTML page will contain the hyperlink
to upper level and home page on the top of the exported web page.
</p>

<p>
I linked both <code>UP</code> and <code>HOME</code> to my home page because
there isn't any other layer between each post and home page.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org-mode">#+HTML_LINK_UP: /note
#+HTML_LINK_HOME: /note
</pre>

<div id="outline-container-orgdfbb291" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgdfbb291"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> <span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> RSS feeds</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
A blog without RSS feeds isn't complete.
But Org Mode didn't have a very good way to generate RSS feeds.

<h2 id="orga5d0afc"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> Links</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
Links work just like paths: <code>/</code> is the root URL, for me it is <code>arhive.casouri.co.uk</code>;
relative links like <code>./</code> and <code>../</code> works just like you would expected.
Since my source files (Org files) and ouput files (HTML files) are under the same directory,
I don't need to worry about path differences.
</p>

<p>
Internal links works without any problem either.
works in both Org file and the exported webpage.
</p>

<p>
Internal links are inserted just like external links: hit <code>C-c C-l</code>, and insert the 
heading or tag you want to link to, <code>RET</code>, insert the display name you want it to have (leave blank if you want none.)

BTW, you can insert a time stamp by <code>C-c .</code>
