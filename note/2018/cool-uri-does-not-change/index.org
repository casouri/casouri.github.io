I recently read this article: [[https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI][Cool URIs don't change]]. (found it on this [[https://ambrevar.xyz/blog-architecture/][blog]])

To summary:
1. URI (should) never change
2. As a webmaster (I like this word!) you should name URIs to last.
3. To design a ever-lasting URI:
  - What to use in URI:
    1. Created time, it never changes. For example the year.
       Another advantage of using created year is that,
       when you refer back to =/2018/pics/= 200 years later,
       you know that it mean what =pic= means in 2018 instead of in 2218.
  - What to leave out (basically anything that might change):
    1. Authors name.
    2. Subject. The author of the original article claims that it changes
       surprisingly fast.
    3. Access. Like group access, personal access, public access, etc.
    4. File name extension.
    5. Software mechanisms. Such as =cgi=, =exce=, =rb=, etc.
