I recently read this article: <a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">Cool URIs don't change</a>. (found it on this <a href="https://ambrevar.xyz/blog-architecture/">blog</a>)
</p>

<p>
To summary:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>URI (should) never change</li>
<li>As a webmaster (I like this word!) you should name URIs to last.</li>
<li>To design a ever-lasting URI:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What to use in URI:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Created time, it never changes. For example the year. Another advantage of using created year is that, when you refer back to <code>/2018/pics/</code> 200 years later, you know that it mean what <code>pic</code> means in 2018 instead of in 2218.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>What to leave out (basically anything that might change):
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Authors name.</li>
<li>Subject. The author of the original article claims that it changes surprisingly fast.</li>
<li>Access. Like group access, personal access, public access, etc.</li>
<li>File name extension.</li>
<li>Software mechanisms. Such as <code>cgi</code>, <code>exce</code>, <code>rb</code>, etc.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
