This nice package [[https://github.com/alphapapa/outshine][outshine]] brings the look and feel of Org Mode into any major mode
as long as there is comment syntax defined.

* How Does It Work

** Enable

#+BEGIN_SRC
M-x outline-minor-mode
#+END_SRC

** Headings

Instead of =*= in Org Mode, use whatever comment syntax defined in the major mode.

In =emacs-lisp-mode=, =;;;= is top level heading, =;;;;= the second, and so on.

** Folding

Since =outshine= is no more than a extension of =outline-minor-mode=,
all the =outline-minor-mode= commands still apply.
To name a few:
#+BEGIN_SRC
outline-show-all
outline-hide-body
outline-toggle-children
#+END_SRC

=outshine= binds =C-M-i= to =outshine-cycle-buffer=, I found it convenient.
