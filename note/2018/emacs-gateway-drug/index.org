Every time I try to introduce my friend Emacs, they ask "why?"
Well I can't really think of anything except "you can do anything you want with it".
Of course that statement is too broad and unconvincing.
So I though I'd collect some cool features that can lure my friends into using Emacs.

These tricks must be easily understandable and looks very cool even to laymen.
