Every time I try to introduce my friend Emacs, they ask "why?" Well I can't really think of anything except "you can do anything you want with it". Of course that statement is too broad and unconvincing. So I though I'd collect some cool features that can lure my friends into using Emacs.

<p>
These tricks must be easily understandable and looks very cool even to laymen. So here we go:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><code>C-f/b</code> <code>M-f/b</code> <code>C-a/e</code></li>
<li><code>undo-tree-visualize</code></li>
<li>Org Mode</li>
<li>Keyboard Macros</li>
<li>Rectangle Selection</li>
<li>query replace</li>
<li>inline-replace</li>
<li>package installation (that's a bit controversial)</li>
<li>regexp-replace</li>
<li>(for programming) outshine</li>
<li>(mostle for programming) magit</li>
</ol>
