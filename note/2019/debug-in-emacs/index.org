This is a note  on debugging in Emacs.

* debug
- ~debug-on-entry~ :: enter the debugger when a function is called
- ~cancel-debug-on-entry~ :: As the name suggests
- ~toggle-debug-on-error~ :: whether to enter the debugger if an error occurs

When you are in the debugger, you have following commands for use:

| =c= | continue, but donâ€™t stop next time.                                          |
| =d= | continue and enter the debugger again next time.                             |
| =e= | evaluate expressions (better than =M-:=).                                    |
| =r= | return a value from debugger.                                                |
| =l= | list functions that will enter the debugger.                                 |
| =b= | flag the current frame so we will enter debugger again when the frame exits. |

* edebug
- ~edebug-defun~ / ~C-u eval-defun~ :: instrument function to enter stepper when the function runs. To cancel the instrument, simply use ~eval-defun~ to reevaluate the function normally.

Some common commands in edebug:
| =n= | step                                                     |
| =q= | quit                                                     |
| =r= | re-display last value in echo area                       |
| =b= | set break point, use ~C-u~ to set a one-time break point |
| =x= | set break condition                                      |
| =c= | continue                                                 |
