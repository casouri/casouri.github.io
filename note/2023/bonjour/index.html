<p>Bonjour is Apple’s implementation of zeroconf networking. With
Bonjour, you can plug in a printer into the local network and expect it
to show up on computers in the network, without manually configuring
anything. Linux’s implementation is Avahi.</p>
<p>I recently needed to use Bonjour for some project and read some
documentation. This is an article summarizing some concepts one needs to
know in order to use a Bonjour library. This article assumes some basic
network knowledge (<span class="smallcaps">tpc/ip</span>, <span class=
"smallcaps">dhcp</span>, <span class="smallcaps">dns</span>, multicast,
unicast, network layers, etc).</p>
<p>Everything in this article is based on Apple’s documentation at
<a href=
"https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/NetServices/Introduction.html#%2F%2Fapple_ref%2Fdoc%2Fuid%2FTP40002445-SW1">
<em>Bonjour Overview</em></a>. (If you want to read it, I recommend
starting with the “Bonjour Operations” section.)</p>
<p>Bonjour operates in the link-local network and provides three
operations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Registering services</li>
<li>Discovering available services</li>
<li>Resolving a service instance name to an address and port</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Registering%20a%20service" class="section">Registering a
service</h2>
<p>When registering/publishing a service, you (or rather the library)
creates a mDNS (multicast <span class="smallcaps">dns</span>) responder
with three records: a service (<span class="smallcaps">srv</span>)
record, a pointer (<span class="smallcaps">ptr</span>) record, and a text
(<span class="smallcaps">txt</span>) record. The text record is for
providing additional information and is usually empty.</p>
<h3 id="Service%20records" class="subsection">Service records</h3>
<p>A service record maps the service name to the host name and the port
of the service. It uses host name rather than an <span class=
"smallcaps">ip</span> address so that the service can be on multiple
<span class="smallcaps">ip</span> addresses at the same time (eg, on both
IPv4 and IPv6).</p>
<p>The full name of a service is made of three parts, the <em>service
instance name</em>, the <em>service type</em>, and the <em>domain</em>,
in the form of:</p>
<pre class=
"code-block">&lt;service instance name&gt;.&lt;service type&gt;.&lt;domain&gt;</pre>
<p>The <em>service instance name</em> is a human-readable string showed
to end-users, encoded in <span class="oldstyle-num">utf-8</span>, and can
be up to <span class="oldstyle-num">63</span> bytes long.</p>
<p>The <em>service type</em> is made of the <em>service type</em> and the
<em>transport protocol</em>, in the form of
<code>_type._protocol.</code>. Eg, <code>_ftp._tcp.</code>. The
underscore prefix is to distinguish from domain names. Bonjour basically
uses the format described in <a href=
"https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2782.txt"><span class=
"oldstyle-num"><span class="smallcaps">rfc 2782</span></span></a>.</p>
<p>Technically, both the type and the protocol are standardized. If you
want to add a service type, you need to register it with <a href=
"https://www.iana.org/form/ports-services"><span class=
"smallcaps">iana</span></a>.</p>
<p>The <em>domain name</em> is just like an Internet domain name, eg,
<code>www.apple.com.</code>. In addition, there is a pseudo domain,
<code>local.</code>, which refers to the link-local network. (So you have
Bonjour to thank when you ssh to <span class="smallcaps">lan</span> hosts
with <code>&lt;host&gt;.local</code>.)</p>
<p>Service instance name, service type, and domain name together make up
the full name of a service instance. For example,</p>
<pre class="code-block">Alice’s Music library._music._tcp.local.</pre>
<h3 id="Pointer%20records" class="subsection">Pointer records</h3>
<p>A pointer record basically maps service types to full service names.
Ie, it maps <code>&lt;service type&gt;.&lt;domain&gt;</code> to
<code>&lt;service instance name&gt;.&lt;service
type&gt;.&lt;domain&gt;</code>. This way you can search for a type of
service and get a list of available service instances.</p>
<h3 id="Publishing%20(advertising)" class="subsection">Publishing
(advertising)</h3>
<p>When publishing a service, a host will first make sure the intended
service instance name is not taken by someone else, by broadcasting
request to that service instance name: if there is a response, the name
is taken. If someone else has taken it, the host will append a number to
the service instance name and increment the number until it gets a name
that no one is using.</p>
<p>If you use a library, this part is taken care for you. But it’s good
to know how does Bonjour avoid name conflicts.</p>
<h2 id="Discovering%20services" class="section">Discovering services</h2>
<p>To discover service instances, you first request <span class=
"smallcaps">ptr</span> records by mDNS, and get back a list of service
instance names. ...And that’s it. The host will save those names, and
resolve a service name into actual address and port every time it needs
to use the service.</p>
<h2 id="Resolving%20service%20names" class="section">Resolving service
names</h2>
<p>By the discovery step, we collected some service instance names that
are available for us in the local network. The next step is to pick one,
resolve it into an actual address and connect to it.</p>
<p>The host will send out a mDNS request for the service instance name,
and get back a host name and a port. It then sends out a mDNS request for
the host name and get an <span class="smallcaps">ip</span> address. Now
it can connect to the address on the port and start using the
service.</p>
