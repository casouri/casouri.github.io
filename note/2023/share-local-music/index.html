<p>The third decade of twenty-first century is strange—people figured out
how to make matrices write stories in the style of King James Bible, but
<a id="footref:send-file" class="footref-anchor obviously-a-link"
aria-label="Jump to footnote" href="#footdef%3Asend-file">there’s no easy
way to send a large file to your friend<sup class=

isn’t going away any time soon.</div>

<p>Another thing you can’t easily do is to listen to your local music
with your friend over the internet. Your only options are either some
janky Discord bot that distorts the sound and can’t find any non-popular
song, or two subscription on some streaming service that has the song you
want to play.</p>
<p>But this is <span class="oldstyle-num">2023</span>, of course there’s
some open source program, that will work brilliantly with just eight
hours of fiddling. Here’s how to fiddle said program and a bit more in
<span class="oldstyle-num">30</span> minutes.</p>
<h2 id="Architecture" class="section">Architecture</h2>
<p>You play music on your computer, the audio stream is captured by a
program, that program sends the audio stream to a server. Your friend
opens a web page which contains a <span class="smallcaps">html</span>
<code>audio</code> tag, which streams music from that server.</p>
<h2 id="Server" class="section">Server</h2>
<p>First, you need a server, ie, any computer that has an publicly
accessible <span class="smallcaps">ip</span>. On that server, install
<a href="https://icecast.org">icecast2</a>. On debian, it’s as simple
as</p>
<pre class="code-block">apt install icecast2</pre>
<p>Then, change the default password and listening port, the config file
is at <code>/etc/icecast2/icecast.xml</code>. You don’t need to touch
anything else.</p>
<p>Now you can start icecast2 and forget about it, the command on Debian
is</p>
<pre class="code-block">systemctl start icecast2</pre>
<h2 id="Local%20streamer" class="section">Local streamer</h2>
<p>Now, install <a href="https://danielnoethen.de/butt/">butt</a>. If you
use Mac, you can also use <a href=
"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ladiocast/id411213048?mt=12">LadioCast</a>.</p>
<p>In butt, open Settings—main—Server Settings—Add, and configure
according to your server:</p>
<ul>
<li>Address: your server’s address</li>
<li>Type: icecast</li>
<li>Port and Password: the port and password you just set for your
server</li>
<li>Icecast mountpoint: anything you like. if it’s “xxx”, the streaming
<span class="smallcaps">url</span> will be <code>&lt;server
address&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/xxx</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Feed%20audio%20output" class="section">Feed audio output</h2>
<p>Now you need to feed <span class="smallcaps">os</span> audio output
into your local streamer. Follow this article: <a href=
"https://danielnoethen.de/butt/howtos/broadcast_audio_files_on_macOS.html">
<em>How to broadcast music files with butt on macOS</em></a>. Then butt
will stream it to icecast2, and whoever listening on <code>&lt;server
address&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/xxx</code> will be able to hear what you are
playing locally.</p>
<h2 id="A%20web%20page" class="section">A web page</h2>
<p>Your friend needs a music player that supports streaming mp3. Or,
better yet, you can host a web page that has a <span class=
"smallcaps">html</span> <code>audio</code> tag that streams audio on
<code>&lt;server address&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/xxx</code>. Then your friend
only need to visit that web page. I’ve written a web page like that, you
can find the kit here: <a href="./uikit.zip">uikit</a>. You need to
change the title in <code>index.html</code>, and change the address in
<code>script.js</code> to your server’s address.</p>
<figure><img src="./uikit.png" alt="A screenshot of the web page">
<figcaption>The web page looks like this</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Additionally, I wrote two scripts that uploads the meta data of the
currently playing song to your server, so the web page can show the
title, artist, album cover, etc. There are two scripts,
<code>itunes.sh</code> and <code>spotify.sh</code>, for each app. Change
the server address in them and run them locally when you play the music.
The scripts are incredibly dumb, and they only work on Mac, but they work
;-)</p>
