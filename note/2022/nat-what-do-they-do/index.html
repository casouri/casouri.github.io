<h1 class="main-title">NAT traversal: STUN, TURN, ICE, what do they
actually do?</h1>
</div>
<p>When searching for NAT traversal I found all these protocols but no
one can tell me what do they essentially do to traverse NAT, surely not
by magic, but what? Turns out it’s conceptually very simple.</p>
<p>What NAT traversal does is not really “punching holes” on the NAT, or
delivering message through some tunnel, or some arcane magic, but to
simply find the public address:port that can can reach <em>me</em>.</p>
<p>If I’m behind a NAT or even multiple NAT’s, what happens is that my
packets get relayed by my NAT’s and they appears on the public Internet
at the out-most NAT’s address with a port assigned to me. And reply
packets going to that address:port are relayed back to me. So essentially
I got a public address:port that can reach me on the public Internet. The
purpose of NAT traversal is to find that public address:port. That’s
basically what the initial/classic STUN (<a href=
"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3489">RFC 3489</a>) does.</p>
<p>The truly host-to-host traversal is just that, finding the public
address:port. Sometimes having that address:port is not enough, because
NAT poses <a id="footref:extra" class="footref-anchor obviously-a-link"
aria-label="Jump to footnote" href="#footdef%3Aextra">extra
restrictions<sup class="inline-footref">1</sup></a>. Then we have to
resort to having a public-visible relay server in the middle, which is
what TURN (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5766">RFC
5766</a>) does. But any host-to-host traversal is just finding public
address:port. There is no extra magic there.</p>
<p>How does the classic STUN works is quite simple. You send a STUN
server a message, the STUN server looks at the source IP address and port
of the IP packet, and reply that back to you. Voilà, you know you public
address:port!</p>
<p>That leaves us with ICE, what does it do? Basically, people realize
that there are so many situations that are wildly different, so there is
no one single method that guarantees to work everywhere. It is best to
try a bunch of ways and pick the one that works and works best.</p>
<p>ICE does basically that. It gathers a bunch of address:port’s that
possibly works (through STUN) and tries them one-by-one according to some
algorithm, and reports to you the best one. If none works, it tries to
establish a relay through TURN.</p>
<p>And here is where the new STUN comes in. People threw away the
algorithm for finding address:port in classic STUN, and kept and extended
the STUN message format. Now ICE runs a more thorough algorithm that uses
STUN messages to communicate with STUN servers. And the new STUN
(<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5389">RFC 5389</a>)
just defines the STUN message format. There is a even newer version
(<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8489">RFC 8489</a>)
that updated RFC 5389 slightly, but with no fundamental changes.</p>
<p>Similarly, TURN is updated in<a href=
"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8656">RFC 8656</a> and now is a
method used by ICE rather than a standalone solution.</p>

<div class="def-footdef">Some NAT wouldn’t let a packet from an external
host through if the host inside never sent a packet to that external host
before. There are many ways a NAT could make your life difficult, check
out “full cone”, “restricted cone”, “symmetric NAT”, etc.</div>
